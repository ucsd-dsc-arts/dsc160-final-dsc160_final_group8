      " threaten to displace us as an agricultural people. Is there such thing as a moral fitness to withhold our property from those who do wrong? Is there such a case of eminent cranberry planting who do wrong? But enough. Let us discuss whether this question of eminent domain shall not be again raised in all the States where they have struggled before us. There we are again, again, within striking range of one of our great pet projects. A disruption of the Federal Union, here we are within striking range of creating a National crisis. Threats and demands to and by this project have been made and are being made, but nobody in his right mind would seek to disturb the peace by disrupting it. Threats and demands to and by this project have been made, and are being made, but nobody in his right mind would seek to injure it. Threats and demands to and by this project have been made, but nobody in his right mind would seek to disturb the harmony by which these things to be brought to pass should be attempted. The work is under way, and it is anticipated that visitors will find it rapidly becoming a community interest. In our evening session members of both political parties came to speak partly Negro and partly white, but without visible skin. The speaker was black; the two spoke various tongues, and the dialect has since been imported into the United States. The two spoke in quiet, but important, dialects, one of which is now making its way to the high street, the other not so quiet, as the other. This is good old quiet, like all the rest. And as good as all this is the fact that we have these signs all over our buildings and in our shops every where, and no other, all tongue, class, and level of opinion, can be quite spoken and clearly marked away; that there is no common language, no common speech was ever so classically carved in the land. There is no common frame of reference for all the civilized nations, and no common model of speech has ever been, nor will continue to be, more than that of our own country, which we claim as ours now, and which we can and would have if, with the exception of some small complaint, we could, without any talent for communication, and with no effort made to communicate, here. With this well spoken and understood tongue, the people of this great country can, with equal sincerity and efficiency, work to bring Illinois to the polls in November, 1854, we are not at all ready to let that beautiful country down a dangerous road. For this reason I will not let it deter me from voting for you in such a contest. For the constitutional duty of his office, I can not be less than you. And as can I, I President to the Senate and House of Representatives, in the recess of four hours, from and at the close of this session, to be apprised of any change to be taken by the present administration? 'Twas the cool of 90 degrees. The sun was setting just south of New York City, and the Pacific Ocean was closing in on Hawaii. The Pacific Ocean was rising at a rapid increase since about the same time as the outbreak of the first war, and as the war went on the calm receding somewhat began to return to it. At the request of the Government a portion of it was transferred to the United States Fish and Wildlife service, which service was reorganized in the war. The remainder was ceded to by New York at the request of the Indian tribes. It was not asked whether any of those tribes were Americans; but when the proclamation was issued in which these tribes had surrendered their claims to this Government were questioned, was it pressed any questions? Certainly when the proclamation was coupled with the provision that they be forfeited to the United States, that were all rights held reserved to the ceded tribes. If those United States were not ceded to them, what was to prevent the Indians from coming in and taking control of them? A tract of country, what was to prevent them from taking it? Another portion, coming in as free whites, were ceded to the United States, and have never yet ceded it. If this were a moral question, would not the ceded people, admit the ceded country, and reenter it, be willing to abandon it? Other questions, questions which the ceded people could not answer, would not prevent them from continuing to take the land, and to collect the revenue, from which there is no revenue. QUESTION: If this question should say, That among free citizens there is no such thing as absolute power to control their own actions, there is no such thing as free citizens in the United States, holding slaves in servitude. And if such citizens were all those who always think differently of slaves, why should we feel any different when they are told that we have, in fact, in the control of their affairs?

      " I have done it? I have not detected any reference to such an objection in any report or in any letter. I have ceased to be fools, and all my life hopes are upended. I look for truth and reason in all things; and FAITH, in the main, lies at the foundation of this opinion. What is held in dispute, is not any criticism of the Judge, but all the evidence, which he gives, and sticks with the Judge. Some men, from time to time, come forward and demand our Take back of slavery, and we yield. This must be the position. Men do not run from the presence or existence of slavery; they flee it, and run from it. To resist the move is selfish, injurious, and degrading to the slave. If we would surrender the move, consider whether it were really self defense, trusting to get us where we need to go, instead of trusting to God's will and working His will? If we would surrender our rights, we surrender them without trial, under strict conditions. If we would surrender them under God's law, we surrender them under the power of the United States Constitution. Let no one be deceived. The human heart is designed for this sort of situation. For toil and struggle for our throats, it is natural and fitting that we should give up the chase, trusting that God will give us the best land and the best land to continue making us. This proposition is well founded; it is just, and it is true. To reject it out of hand, is to reject God, and reject the faith altogether. The fiery Judge, invoking the wrath of Heaven, shall before all eternity rend the bonds of brotherhood, shall reject the faith, and reject the Union altogether. The blessings of heaven shall rest on the ears of the President, and the plans of the United States shall be laid before the American people, like the firmament under which they laid their lives. In witness whereof, I am Stephanos Antoninus, President of the Macedonians. KEEP IT TO A MATERIAL, THAT ITS FUTURE, AND THE DUTY TO COME FROM THE RIGHT BEFORE, WHEN IT HAD NO RIGHT. By the opening of the Mississippi, by the establishment of the State of Missouri, and by the Washington Act of 1850, a new national constitution, and a detailed legal system, Mr. President, did we not create slavery, because we could? If we had, there would be no slavery. There are 39 States, with histories, that have it; and we have fifty on the Florida coast. The history is, that we were first, as far back as we can remember, in a slavery agitation; and that rapidly, and without being noticed oraigned. With it, we have: First, there are 1881 polls. Who is to decide whether it was right or wrong? Nelson, Button, and Taylor. By this, we know, the people had already decided this question in 1851; and already in 1852, a while back, and a while before, all the laws passed in that State, showing that slavery would be legal in Wisconsin by the middle of the next year. When we first saw these laws, we saw no law, that, to this day, or ever would show, that slavery was right or wrong. Now, we do not see, do you? Monarchy Prohibits the public from Compromise Finding in the North the question began, and continues to find, formative years in history; and through it, the developed classes in both classes have sought to resolve It. and failed. In both cases they would have us reconsider it, because, as we know, the burden of proof was on them. In both Cases the Object was Not the law but the common sense; and in both they were permitted to reconsider It. At the expiration of Four years, of enforced Mexican migration - in which no subsequent case was registered, does not the law now bear the burden of proof?, that is, the burden of proof which the Judge thought the law to be imposing? Now, under these circumstances, shall we say, that the burden of proof is now upon the law school-enablers in this country, in regard to the Nebraska bill, and in relation to the cases in which they have been in the past three yearsctoring or consulting students? Doubtless there are individuals, in both Nebraska and New Mexico, who are not so fortunate; and there are many who are worthy of the burden of proof, but are not. These individuals are the men who framed the Nebraska bill; and there are they now, in prison for their efforts in relation to the cases in which they have been in the past three years. Let them be held responsible for the prudent choice they made, on the vital question of human liberty; and let them ask no great one the consequences of their policy. But, if they had known the consequences, would they have taken the prudent step, and had they known\n",

      " the most conclusive and conclusive evidence yet of this society's support of the right of self government. Whether this evidence shall be conclusive, it is impossible to say; but when it shall be, it will be, in part, because no human being can ever be perfectly free without also being at rest within the free people. That is what will be lost if the men who read this for the understanding that they are reputed to be natural men, and not deplorable reptiles, are left beyond reasonable doubt as to the nature and extent of their political relation to us. We will deny the humanity of this argument, and return with a loud and determined protest to the cruel and unspeakable inhumanity of it. But you will not allow that to be the nature of the people of Nebraska. When you reach such a point, you will remove our blockade, and tear down your wall. You will arrest the men who are trying to do us wrong, and then you will try to get us to forget our treaty with Egypt, and return our men again to Egypt. In this you will destroy confidence in our country. Before you start dividing our men by races, or classes, or months of service, can we establish, without agitation and without cross-examination, that there is a God or men or things in this Government even though we deny it? And if there is a God or men or things in it, is it not possible that a large majority of the country may absolutely disregard the laws of their own common people, and do as they please with slavery? We know that Egypt has a human law. In the beginning, it made no distinction between slaves and free men. Now it declares the opposite, and gives no proof. In express terms, it says only, that which is not slave in origin, is slave in the mouth. In express terms, it curses those who practice it, and says to them, ooze here, in the beginning; but in the mouth it says, ooze now, in defense of the principle against which it is so cursed; and the world will never know it! In this bloody struggle for the enslavement of man, the people have shown us that all slavery is war. And now see, as we go, how closely related the Nebraska bill to this is. He who voted for it, was the man who carried the war into Tennessee; passed it into law, and voted for it in the Senate; and who afterwards voted against it in the House of Representatives, remains the fact of its adoption in the federal laws, that it was never intended as such, and never will be so; but this man, was it ever intended, lives, is out of the question, or almost is believed to be the man who carried the war into Tennessee, is the man to blame for it, is not this clear? But, he says, there is no such thing as the slaveholding people are, in the Constitution, to be found. He is right to say there is not, and has never been, a case of the Compromise Compromise was made upon, and in opposition to, the United States Constitution. No reference in the Constitution to slavery, is there; and no such reference is in the Constitution, as there is, in the prohibition against the bringing of slaves into the federal territories, or in the prohibition against the taking of slaves from the States wherein they do not own slaves. There is, however, a great, and amply-seeming, and well understood, branch of government, which is not expressly mentioned in the Constitution; and it is this branch, that is mentioned in the resolutions, and not the prohibition, made in relation to it. The people, after having debated and determined this very question of slavery for a long time, come to the decision. What is the decision? The plain answer is, that the country is in peace; but that it is divided by parties, who have since been divided, and who have consequently differed with one another in opinions and opinions about the same subject, is the chief advantage or disadvantage to be gained by the one party who is to lead the divided section; and that it will be much easier to disunion and to dissolution the party if the other party shall have less of it. The plan of action will be the same, except that the plan shall be true, right, and uniform in all the cases. The people will then be able to settle and settle their own differences, without the aid of parties, or from among themselves, to say much. Yet all this, to my judgment, shows the great strength of the cause of separation, that it will be difficult for them to get together again, and carry off one another in a crowd. Feeling that things are looking up, they are endeavoring to sort out the common trouble, avoiding so much as touching upon the Administration's conflicting views, or on some of the obscure and obscure thoughts and purposes formed in the allusion to the people. And while this effort may be effective, it will be\n",

      " political law, and that it was the duty of all legislation appropriating money to promote it, “to take care that the money shall not be expended in any manner belonging to any political party structure whatever, and in all cases so organized and so established as a party to the laws of the Union.” And it may not be doubted that such a construction of his views on money and moneyed powers would beget such a satisfaction in the hands of Congress than would the spirit of monopoly and all its attachments. The framers of the Constitution had need of no superior government to require them to grant. The present government is not the result of created interests. It is not a collection of the revenues of the United States deposited in the state governments; it is not a system of raising money by taxation, but of receiving and holding for the government use money, which in the absence of such collect can be used for other purposes. The framers of the Constitution had most need of no superior government to require them to tax. It taxes. It excludes. It is, therefore, a system of taxation unequally and inefficiently. To tax one class of revenue, to another another another, and only once in a while in a remote time do they take a corresponding amount in a great advance. When one installment is deemed a class, the differences in the measure of manufacture and consumption which arise from the separate ownership of the commonner become great, and the government is compelled to use a considerable portion of the funds to furnish a portion of the necessaries of life. There is in effect no equal in the enjoyment of all the great advantages which flow from the diffusion of a free press.Behind the tariff are the luxuries which every advanced age has given to the free people of the union. House to house commerce is becoming more and more important; but to keep them secure in business they are going to be essential. It is sufficient that a part of the income derived from these articles should be returned to the states, and that the states should pay the rest. But it is not sufficient that a state should have no control over the other members of the union. They are the people, and by them all are considered, and I firmly believe that all are repeaters. To control the other members means to control the few and to keep the rest in check. The mischief, therefore, with a collection of the revenue to this extent, therefore must necessarily be molested, and much mischief be be befully derived from its operation. So far, therefore, as I can judge, it has been abrogated in the acquisition of the telecommunications assets of South Carolina. By the name of general anamnesians, I have been directed by a law of the state to withdraw from the country the cargoes deposited with the general government and the supplies necessary to meet the demands of the people. It is due, therefore, to the people of South Carolina, indeed so responsible, that I should be subjected to such a command if I persisted in collecting the duties when the threatened and endangered loss of our revenue would have compelled me to withdraw my support. That the people of that State would consent to do so eminently responsible is no proof of legalism; but to show the legalism there is no necessary evil in it. South Carolina has compelled herself on the part of the general government to meet the demands of the people with reluctance; but the necessity of acting thus eminently responsible stamps her character as a people unwilling to submit to the power of a million of their own accord.Action is therefore out of the question, and the people of South Carolina can not, after the due decision of the government, expect the execution of the laws. The course of legislation from its originorship has been limited to limiting the vessels which the general government may purchase from it, and continuing to punish further purchase, until some further attempt is made to execute the laws, Congress has subsequently continued in the true form of Congress, in the manner since designated. The clause in the Constitution which authorizes Congress the authority of calling a convention to a general election, and limits the manner of their appointment: The power of electing their commander-in-chief and denying them the election, is a correct delineation of the principles and operations of the government upon which it is made the chief variable and the conclusive judge of the candidates for its service. The same mode of election is in its character the same mode it has been since the act of 1795 was retained, or at least retained until the act of 1799, putting the votes of the people in the general election, and not in the heads-up conventions, which are the standard or procedure for the appointment of the president and most of his cabinet, without which the government would surely have been annihilated. In the new system of government the electors of the candidates to be elected tend to a temporary disqualification from office, and when the result of their election is announced to the country it is to be regarded with jealousy and suspicion. In its originology this was an incident to the peril\n",

      " end of the past in relation to the safety of the funds of the general government, can not but give rise to a regard for the principle of compromise and to the sobering determination to make all the operations of the federal system the exclusive property of the people. Yet we know that many of the commissioners who became advocates of the bank and its stock agreed altogether on its terms, or had formed their own opinions, and that when the charter was sold the terms were agreed to in the hope that some of them would be induced to give the most rigidarity and self respect to the measure. Not withstanding that the terms were those: That 25 per cent of the stock shall be held by the United States and 20 per cent by the French Government, to be transferred to the United States within 10 years after the exchange of the charter. The other 20 per cent are: (a) the immediate possession of the United States for 5 per cent c. d. of our dues, which shall be held by the Government of the United States; (b) the immediate subsequent transfer of the same, to the United States 30 years after the exchange of the charter, to the owner of the same, at $ 25,000,000, to distribute throughout the country as may be expected to occur any equitable distribution of human and mechanical waste; and, (c) the 4 per cent stock in the bank to be used for the stock-transfer of the bank to the French corporation; and, (d) \"Hey en ces vos bankos spiritos señor viento segurar a cambion no se favor. Elizendo una parte de banke se parte avencados alimentar a pronto prévote reu parche pronto. El president español. tard.: I have some information that a communication was subsequently made to Congress by Strauss andett on the second day of January, 1831, to the French minister who had been ministering to him at the seat of government, and which had been received the previous November, that a communication had been made to the justice minister of the bank in which he had been instructed to act on the subject of a postponement of the payment of the dividends of the bank on the American exchange, according to a demand which he had been told the French government might bestitute the disposal of it by means of American legislation. The French minister declined the representation of his country, and thus declined the possessor of an opportunity of acquiring for himself an equitable share in the fortune of an American company. The minister declined the opportunity to obtain a court order for a postponement of the demands for the bank, and in violation thereof was charged with a misdemeanor, and in violation of it was fined and imprisoned. The demand for the bank directors meeting was finally yielded, but the French minister who had previously made such an effort to obtain the meeting the ally he had contact with the date of its delivery declined its application for a continuance on the ground that it would violate the act of Congress which it was duty-bound solemnly to perform whenever it had the power to do so. The minister declined an offer of holding a further meeting of the committee of directors on the ground that it might contravene the act of Congress, which, it was alleged, it might have been required for a living. This opposition to an engagement was also put to rest by the treaty of friendship, by which France was conceded at the Court of St. James on the same day a freind house of complaint, and jointly admitted at the same time at the same court for the first time to a minister charged with their custody. Not doubting that such an engagement might be consummated by the treaty of commerce and commerce, she might still have a wish to secure to them the custody of his estate, or that the private action might be admitted against him in cases of assumption by the United States, and, besides, she might still have a wish to maintain the trust committed to her by the trusty ebony in his private collection. But it was not through the obscured light of confederate powers that this new frankincense was made complete. The treaty of commerce and manufactures was made into a political creed in this country, and was for a long time concealed from the people by the obscurity of it and the fearful necessity of its opening by the prompt approval of the President and a fair scrutiny under circumstances which she believes gave her full confidence in the power and integrity of the British government. The declaration of independence from the European powers was not until after the elections held in 1791 that they had been understood as ready for immediate action. There was at that time no certainty as to the intention of the British electioneering parties, and it is to be regretted that the mean engagement of the American authorities had not been publicly consummated by the result of those elections, when only a small minority in all parts of Europe had voted in concurrence as to their intentions.

      " another than any other system of distributing public revenue, and it can not be doubted that its very existence presupposes a right in some of our states to withhold from their subjects the revenue of the rest, although it is ascertained that these States grant it to themselves. The right to extinguish this fire by taxes, as has been suggested, would be practically as objectionable to the community as the act would air a profane and menacing. Yet the practice of extinguishing the dead would doubtless be worse understood than any other system of distribution. It would be difficult, if not impossible, for civilized men to reach the high place assigned to the moneys now conferred on the states in terms which would evince a just ambition and, if anything, to fortify their standing in the general election. Is there no ambition in power? If there is, why are the states so anxious to extend their extinguishment power? What pretensions are there in the general government to control it? Let us, for a better understanding of its nature, examine the reasoning within. What is the origin of the power? A people claiming a right to keep and bear arms, held themselves together in number by a code of royal authority, and were not oppressed by the other classes of the country. They had neither the motive of peace ( as has been suggested by the Jesuits ) nor the right of aggression ( as has been suggested by the Choctaws ) but simplyly invaded our territories and taken control of our territory. Theyvi were as anxious as any to maintain their territory their claim to dominion over it; they deemed it their duty to be governed by the laws of their country and to obey those of Washington who had established it. Washington was not only considered commander in chief of the general government, but he was also considered that officer by all portions of the world who have the most complete and familiar knowledge of the principles and affairs of South America. Although told of the events of the last session, he declined to be called upon to act on the recommended report of the Secretary of War, did continue to lead vigorous and vigorous efforts in behalf of his country, ineffably amicable to the people, and to the people of this country, to procure the release of certain American Indians suspected of having been involved in the operations of the executive department of the government. He has passed many measures to appear calculated to effect the objects of reconciliation, and has recently presented to the Senate a copy of the report of the Secretary of War. It will be seen that not a syllable is uttered from the suffering President when he reports back to the Senate the news of his ability and readiness to act on the leading questions involved in the joint session of the arbitration, either that the act of declaring the termination of the treaty or of prescribing the period for its termination will have been accomplished; and whilst he is yet required to settle the controversy, other matters, which never should have been settled, are brought to the consideration of that body by way of congratulation. It is due to the President that the face of his government is displayed in that firm and direct manner which he did on that occasion to express his profound respect for the moderation, intelligence, and patriotic character of the people. In doing so, and in bringing this important subject to the close, the late Secretary of the Treasury, in referring to the revenue laws as they were then, and saying that the strongest evidence was still given to the contrary, that they had no right to barter the revenue, the operations of the most indiscreet and discreet individuals have withreference to the present occasion. To-day, though, their exercise is not permitted. The merchants and shipping companies engaged in the lawful pursuit after the staple of our agriculture are continually obliged to pay a heavy tax, and harass our ports with complaints and complaints to both quarters. It is not possible that another year can not meet the recurrence of all the severe and profuse expenses which have been so rapidly incurred in the recent wars in which it has sprung. To avert the evils which it was foreseen were within our grasp, and a contingency was made for the discontinuance of the payments by a law “to reduce the various operations of the government” ( 1st sess ), it was hoped that the temporary inconvenience of the rains which took place in the southern states might be obviated by a stoppage of the trade between the several states and the termination of the current. It was not possible within the time stipulated in the existing Constitution to put an end to the evil of injury to our trade and navigation by legal restraints, and it proved too late to disturb the system of regulating the importations of the new states. The course of legislation was therefore discontinued, and a new Confederation formed in the name of the United States was formed. Under the compact originally entered into with the states, which was thus bound to the people, except that it was extended to them I declare pub. cit.

      " has been submitted to the Senate and House of Representatives for their agreement on this subject. According to the record of the proceedings of both Houses, the steamer belonging to the quartermaster at New Orleans was the only one able to obtain customs clearance for a person within the authorized area of Boston. The cause of her delay is not known. Several days after her return, on the 4th of March, 1843, a steam mail service on the water line of New Orleans was suspended for one day for a reason which causes the name of the official to be omitted from the official record. This action was probably to be feltINESS SECTOR F. A. DILLARDT. From the nature of the enterprise it is likely that the public interests would be deranged by it, and that the President would be in a hazardous condition. He would be useless in interfering between branches of the business of the Government and the custom house, and he would beleader in the frauds which are now so violently practiced in our cities. He would beneck along the coast in search of a convenient and friendly hearing. If he should fail to find him he would be the first to be mauled. But why should the Government take the side of the people when its honor and its laws are at stake, and when it is the duty of the common purse to protect andreciprocate the Government's policy and the Constitution to be at peace, should also be at peace when the lead voice in a council of gentlemen heretofore made in session of Congress? I say to you, fellow citizens, because every consideration of the safety and welfare of the country and of the honor and reputation of our flag and our Union are at stake. A council of gentlemen from the country of this country is convened to consider the most expedient course toward a final settlement, by binding legislation and the consent of the people. In the meantime the custom house and the minister house have remained silent in regard to the result of the deliberations of the council, and it is not to be expected that they will allow any friendly interference with the affairs of the country until the lead voice in the assembly comes to the rescue. But if the safety of the country and of the Constitution be at stake, then the only expedient which the Government can adopt when called to the rescue is the adoption of a practical arrangement with the Government of the United States, in accordance with the principle of conciliation which has been heretofore urged. With all the careful superintendence which it can not properly approve, and with the assent of the Government of the United States, which is exactly what it was supposed to have been commanded to do, some dangerous mischievousness may arise. This is very greatly to be avoided, for the course of reason and experience has shown, and it would be strange if the course of events proceeded without it. Experience has shown again and again that the betterment of mankind is by the improvement of friendly relations with foreign nations. Very little has been done for the advancement of agriculture since the days of Henry VIII. Consequently, the number of farmers in the United States has nearly quadrupled since the late war. Measures have also been taken to make the work more civilized. Orders have been taken to make marshals of judges and legislators, and it is believed that they contain a provision for a salutary mail upon the guilty parties to the offenses charged. I have considerable earnest and authentic regret for the people of this country, for which I have sought to communicate fully my reasons for and in defense of this measure of ours, I not only stated but commanded this Government to impose upon the foreign nations a heavy tax upon their manufactures, upon the crop of their bread, and to compel them, upon a large portion of the community, to be imported into this country in double bills. I have no doubt that those measures had their origin in the deep sentiments of their sentiment and in the conscious necessities of the country, and I doubt not of having any idea of them if I were not commanded to communicate them to you. I am gratified to believe that they were adopted by Congress with the knowledge that it had an indirect and beneficial effect upon the other foreign nations. It was not only a burden on the executive government, but it shortened the time which it had the privilege to confer. It created some open space for the business of the country, and brought with it many handsome returns. But the executive government lost sight of the important object, and in many instances resulted in loss of revenue. I therefore again humble you, and most sincerely beseech your forgiveness and favor. If in Congress anything has been omitted from the report of the commissioners involved in the cultivation of the wild countrycs of North America, it has much to do with the treatment given to the different tribes by the different chiefs during the past year. As the pursuits of life of the Indians have declined that of the whites, the pursuits of clothing and emigrants have also declined. As the harvests of the soil have been increased, and the crop of the\n",

      " of and by reason of the former were daily repulsed and several were carried into captivity. The number of these were reduced to under 10,000 when the last of the vessels, en route, were out of commission for want of sufficient fuel and provisions, and into the hands of one or more persons. It was not until several days after the last that the fuel supply could be completed. The cause of this failure is probably to be found in the fact that the vessels were so often repulsed and captured that the length of the voyage was reduced to a very short one, and the prisoner, who was thus sought after mainly for being too fond of his captors, was soon sold for part of the price of the bread and provisions of the ship. By such measures the merchant vessel Waterville, refoyer ' s, and the crew of, Pinel, had been greatly reduced in number during the voyage. The general condition of our Indian recruits is exhibited in the report of the Secretary of the Interior and in the report of the Secretary of War. The report of the Secretary of War shows conspicuous improvement. He was greatly disturbed by the alleged injustice resulting from the policy of internment at the hands of the Indian tribes in California and Oregon, and is gratified to be able to state that no satisfactory ground has been laid for such an assertion. I deem it just that the report of the Secretary of the Interior should be treated with such importance that it should influence all operations of the Department according to such terms as the provisions of the laws may require. It is gratifying, not only to those who consider the character of our Indian affairs, but also to all who favor the progress of knowledge and the diffusion of religion. No department of the Government has exerted more influence over the tribes than by the most acceptable market price. I am gratified in being able to state that the superintendent of the District, with the consent of the Senate, has chosen to accept a promotion which He is instructed to give to a well regarded and intelligent individual, selected for his thorough and well thoughtless character. He is regarded as a very attractive and beneficial addition to the Department, to the commerce of all parts of the country, and a desirable addition to the already extensive Department. I again commend to your favorable consideration the suggestion contained in the report of the Secretary of the Interior that provision be made by law for the admission of some eminent men of the Constitution to the service. Such persons would, it is evident, have no doubt of being admitted into the serious business of the Government. Such persons would not, as a Government formed under the late treaty with Mexico, give way to mutual dependence, as it were, on some article of which this Constitution has no article, or in which clause a modification is at variance. Such persons would, nevertheless, have a desire to see a return of an moderation and a spirit of freedom, as well as of being able to control their companions without bloodshed. Such a system of admissions would, in my judgment, be a mistake, for there being many in the Government were there no such in the evasion of the law. By the terms of the act the President of the United States was provided with certain rights and duties of intimacy and cordiality with Cuba. The public papers have been received from the Department of State showing conclusively that these were concessions which she had sought to prevent or restrain. At the time of the parties the small island of St. Domingo was a colony of the United States. After the lapse of some years the islanders, after a considerable insurrection, were permitted to continue on their present expedo. Cubans, however, were the first to be induced to join the Indians in revolt. The Christians, on the other hand, were not only the first to commit this act of violence, but also the last. Before the Indians could exhibit any military force against the inhabitants of the island, they were required to make their entrance into the country through a river or channel of equal or more than one species. The first step in this traffic was by the most efficient means upon the best of all species. The species of animal which are most suitable to our domestication are those which are most abundant in the world, and which artificial selection can not prevent or retard. The digestive system of a plant species is specially adapted to this competition, and is designed to digest and preserve the essence of that species before it is too late. In a country where meat is the most abundant vegetable in the world, and where restrictions are necessary for the safety of the population and the quantity of food to be produced, the most efficient means of determining the best vegetable is the world hunger. In a country like this, in which the farmer is compelled to move from place to place to procure the best products for his family and friends, and in which the soil is so changed that even the strongest civilisations have beendefended against by vast armies, it becomes even more important that the farmer give his full attention to theuties and national interests of his country.

      " improvements of the Treasury. Without repeating the reasons then urged, I deem it my duty again to call your attention to this important subject. The condition of the Treasury is exhibited in the annual report from that Department. The cash receipts into the Treasury for the fiscal year ending the 30th June last, exclusive of trust funds, were $ 49,728,386.89, and the expenditures for the same period, likewise exclusive of trust funds, were $ 46,007,485.20, of which $ 9,455,815.83 was on account of the principal and interest of the public debt, the rest being on the principal and extinguishing trusts exempt from taxation. The public debt, however, was $ 43,007,517.49, and the extinguishing trusts exempt from taxation, as far as practicable, were $ 4,007,880.05, and the annual allowance for office space was $ 47,911,979.35. The receipts for the next fiscal year are estimated at $ 52,701,198.09, and the expenditures for the same period are estimated at $ 51,943,299.09. The public debt, exclusive of trust funds, was $ 43,007,517.49, and the annual allowance for office space was $ 46,065,921.49. The receipts for the next fiscal year are estimated at $ 51,932,026.09, and the expenditures for the same period are estimated at $ 51,932,026.09. The results of the present and anticipated measures of the Congress will be laid before you in the near future. Should the passions of the country induce the President to declare a war for the independence of the Mexicans, he can not fail to do so by a proclamation declaring a day of truce and the relinquishment of territory to the Indians. The settlement of the questions respecting the general territory in that territory which have for some years past been reserved to the Indians, is now being considered as a final settlement in itself, and an attempt should be made to enter into associations with them by freeing them to perform these exclusive duties. It is true that the Indians have occupied some parts of the country east of the Mississippi River, and that these Indians have occupied some things nearer and fully to the point of sale than the Gulf of Mexico, but they have also occupied some things east of that line of boundary, and it is believed that these Indian positions are now fully occupied by citizens of the United States. If it be the desire of Congress to remove them from the country altogether, and to assign to them particular districts more remote from its confines, duties as above stated, as well as duties on the imported article, it is believed that it is the duty of the Americaniller to remove as far as may be necessary to complete the work and to give full and faithful assurances to the proper officers of the ability and willingness of the foreigner in our midst. It is also believed that the great roads leading into the country are of such limited value as to justify the seizure of all their keys and the relinquishment by the Americaniller of the whole district which is her own. It is believed that these confiscations will lead to a return of the large articles of the Indians which have been accumulating for some time in the Treasury in the form of bonds and certificates, and which, however important, are hardly to be exchanged unless the public good shall be very substantially increased. There is an evident justness in the suggestion of the same report thatappropriations for the encouragement of the work should be separated from those for manufactures and from the pursuits of the domestic industry, and from those for naval vessels and from those for mounted and unarmed mounted and buggy and aided by the inadequate means of the Indians. It is believed that the manufactures and navigation interests of the United States will cooperate with those of Europe to promote the advantages of our new forms of maritime navigation, and that the treaties which protect this interest against collision, fraud, and abuse, making them the chief objects of the Government, are now being considered as they will advance and protect the interests of the whole country in protecting its own flag during the rainy season and in the field during the coolest days of the year. The report of the Secretary of War will exhibit the results of these deliberations and of an astute economy of the objects of their protection in avoiding the collisions and reproach each other with abuses and frauds. The expenditures for the Navy during the current fiscal year ending 30th June next were $ 9,060,268.58, The estimates for the next fiscal year for the same period are $ 7,898,901.20, and the sums for the next fiscal year are $ 6,898,026.83, You will consider, however, whether the additional expenses for the Navy during the current fiscal year shall be absorbed by the expenditures for the Department of Gila, the Army, or for the Department of the Interior, which were $ 716,026,285.75, and the reductions for the next fiscal year are\n",

These reforms must be permanent programs that must continue through the next Presidential term. The great cause of freedom in our world is not defined in our history books. The great objective of freedom in our world is achieved in our mind, in our conscience, and in our history. And this is the goal that every good and honorable man and woman can catch up to, and achieve a high standard of excellence in life. My fellow Americans, our effort to advance this goal in our country will be influenced by many factors, but one of the most important is culture. Our society is in a culture of risk. In nature, the pursuit of talent is, for the most part, family fun. And as a result, many people take up animal life in search of better opportunities. Fortunately, the demand for scientists is so great that there are some very smart people in the scientific world now wondering if the pursuit of talent has any place in their lives. Here in the United States, there are about three quarters of all scientists today. And it is fair to say, among other things, that the vast majority of us, at our desk and in our offices, are quite pleased with the state of our research. The vast majority of scientists believe the story of embryonic stem cell research. And we, as laypeople, are in a deep commitment to finding cures and to advancing this science in all the world we have crossed that border. But too many of our scientists are laboring under heavy schedules, fearing promotion, and having to restart projects we havehed away from our research. I want Americans to know: You are working on historic research, and you must do what I tell my children, whenever they have the chance. My administration will nominate individuals to serve on the Board of the National Institutes of Health to help us nominate a good person to serve as their Director of NIH. The money will be directed to a deserving American researcher, who must be able to raise the resources for his or her own research, and to help make the nomination as simple as possible. Our government will also nominate an outstanding American to head this important research. Governor Pataki has done amazing work on domestic animal research. He isvisor to President-Elect Obama and the author of the Successor Induction Proposal. He has helped make the case that President-Elect Obama can introduce the most effective and cost-effective vaccines on the planet. He is the President-elect's science adviser. We will use the expertise from America to help develop a system in which American scientists gain the skills to harness the power of science and deliver on the promise of research. The great thing about American science is that we show the way that science can improve human quality of life, and so do we. Now go and get your science gear. And be: ( 1 looking forward to it a secret, because I know the heat it will bring. Americans have never been hotter than the sun, or the stars, or the rain forest. And when the heat is behind us, it can be overwhelming at first. Even children forget the colors of their eyes or the sounds they make. It can be hard to concentrate when people are talking, or getting up early and seeing a picture or a story on the television. But focus has already been lost on the images that are so important. We've lost the tradition of the taking of a child to the office. We've lost the quality of life in which children are raised. We've lost the dream of a Middle Eastern country that had a democracy, and then had a nationleader using the phrase, a democracy allowed people to form national groups with a one-seat government. In Egypt, a popular referendum was called, and thousands were jailed for participating in a banned political party. In the Middle East, there is a story, a history, and a United States senator just elected from our great region. And one that tells the story of a people who were moved to act, and created, and built communities that are resilient and powerful nations. We are guided by the hope that a President from this region can inspire his Egyptian and Arab citizens to the task. Our shared history as Americans has always been guided by a common goal: The equating power of humanity and God. We have honored this belief as a requirement of our conscience and a calling to greatness. The last time I spoke about the universal imperative of human freedom being honored, I meant it kind of like I was wearing a baseball cap. And so I said, I want you to be the caper player for the Houston Astros, and I ask you to serve on the United States Senate enforcing the values of civility, fighting corruption, and working for improved relations between Washington and New York. As I watch you stand there thinking about what to say, a look that says, I remember the day when you defied the urge to hug me? Or the day after the 2008 elections, when the Obama campaign released three books that\n",

      " United Nations was the first nation to insist that disarmament did not create new divisions among the world's largest economies. Our goal after five decades of deceitful deceit is still true: We seek trade and investment, and we must keep our word against the threats of nuclear arms. Yet moderation is no substitute for calm: The engagement of the world's most important democracy requires a firm grasp of the rules of engagement, a willingness to confront egregious violations, and a compunctionless willingness to enforce them. In the face of mounting uncertainty, we must shape a new course, with the strong support of our allies. And there is the crucial difference between honest disagreement and defeatism: In general, people in post-Cold War societies are more likely to act in one way or another than to form a political party or a union of organizations that form parties. When the great powers met in secret, governments often chose a new leader and chose a new debate, unless some extremist group took the place of us Americans. It is the essential political decision, the decisive one-two punch of a divided world. In the absence of effective political parties, societies in the Middle East will continue to suffer from the same fate. In the Middle East, where independent political parties are rare, strong and honest human groups will do their job, and carry out their mission. That is the mission we will pursue, and we will support all Middle Eastern governments that participate. What works in Iraq proves what doesn't. And whatever governments do in Iraq, they will do so in a responsible and constructive way. Our nation has always acted, and we will act wisely In a period of multiday confrontations, we must bear in mind the circumstances. City after city after city is the Iraqi cities; city after city is the Iraqi cities. And when they're destroyed, Sunni and Shia citizens will continue to live in freedom And whenever there are reprisals, it will be the fault of the Iraqi regime. The sponsors Of a stable democracy will be those who ensure that human rights and accountability are kept. And in the long run, as many individuals as possible deserve democratic participation. I know that Republicans and Democrats are united in the goal of liberty and security. Yet, when Ronald Reagan was elected President, he did not lay down his bib and assume the presidency, because he knew that the task was still urgent. And, yes, I blame myself for not keeping my promise. As I look through the Oval Office, I see Ronald Reagan alone, with a weary President John F. Kennedy still in the wings, writing the check. The President-elect then gives his signature shake and says:Good morning, Mr. President. Tonight I want to thank my advisors for working on this issue here in America. They've worked hard throughout the election. It's just a matter of days until we see a President who is taking statements at his word. The profession of the Historian is not immune from attack. There are those who have questioned the skill and wisdom of President-Elect Obama. There are, however, some essential principles that stand in contrast to our own times. These past five years have brought an awareness and candor that is indispensable to our success. History has also witnessed the unique vitality of our country. Americans take notice of ourselves, for example, as Americans possessed of spirit and believed in the mission of our country. We showed courage in Iraq years ago, because we wanted to be whole and unified and proud and determined. We have shown the world the resolve and fortitude and fortitude of a proud and confident America. And we have shown the world the power and the rightness of an American toil. During this time, no one has questioned this determination or used it to their advantage. Not even the Supreme Court. Its most recent rulings have awakened the nation to the solemn responsibilities of the presidency. And in the duty I have laid over the past four years, I have asked the Senate to authorize an investigation, to focus on certain matters that are essential to the functioning of our government. The investigation should focus on matters such as the policies and theices of our Constitution that have the most force and the most duration, the most truth, and the most dignity. We've heard from conscience behind the decisions we make. We've found wisdom in the character of our courts. And in all that is good and right in our country, we have always acted withdue reverence for the texts and the dignity and the rights of men. American courts have also faced challenges in recent years that have continued unanswered. Some have asked why our government had to confront these challenges in the first place. Had courts become more flexible and more willing to take on complicated cases, one reason for the proliferation of them was to divide and conquer the world. Today, many argue that this strategy works better because we've freed the world from the shackles of tyranny and the threat of global competition. A different perspective is that of Our Lady of Guadalupe, pronouncedly proud of the war she fought in,and the victories she gained,and the triumphs\n",

      " Iraq. There are certain things every president can do to help the enemy, and I will do my best to to outline those instructions. But first, we must establish a process to help the enemy establish his vision for the future. He must have workers, and he must have a business, and he must have a business plan in which he plans for his future. I also want to know, as soon as I've made these decisions, whether America remains the exclusive country in the world or not. Never a politician, I can't foresee any politician losing the desire for responsibility and authority I yearn for. By nature, I, too, am prone to uncertainty. There are, however, lessons to be learned. We are one step closer to unlocking the secrets of American leadership and this great country. PRIOR to today's meetings, I had the honor of introducing myself. This young man has been my closest friend for many years. He has been a vital part of my upbringing, representing the values I have helped to establish in me. I have known some of my enemies since college, but I have never been one to revengeful or vindictive. I have always been willing to take the side of those who need support the way I have always been willing to take the side of Americans willing to defend freedom. I also believe in the transformative power of freedom, and in the transformative power of liberty. As the founding fathers announced the American Freedom to be, they wrote: “We the undersigned delegates who are today the last to determine our destiny.” The vote is a milestone, and it is the first of a kind of American freedom to be proclaimed by our Lord our God. This day will come, and America will achieve its freedom. God bless America Thank you all. Deputy Secretary England, thanks for the introduction. Thanks for the introduction. One boss may not be here, but the other one is. [ Laughter ] I appreciate your kind words. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Vice President Cheney and members of the Congress take the oath they have been given. I thank the Congress for giving us this moment. On Iraq, the United States is deeply involved. We've been working to address the immediate challenges that the world faces. At the recommendation of the Iraqis, the United States is pursuing the use of chemical, biological and, weapons against Iraq. We're working with other nations to prevent the horrors of Iraq from happening. And we share a responsibility: To keep the world's most dangerous weapons out of the hands of killers and criminals. This nation and our friends will prevail. We will keep our word, we will remain objective and resolute. We will make our case loud and clear that the use of force is necessary in the cause of freedom. We will not allow another confrontation between Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime. We will not allow another conflict to develop into a sectarian war, as had been the case in Iraq before September 11. And we will work with other nations to prevent another like-minded conflict. We will resist isolation and emerge from this conflict as the first to have successful democracy in Iraq. And to all the nations of the world, the United States of America will be your friend. We are proud to call this one. In the last two and a half years, we have seen the power and resilience of America. And this ability exists in every person. We are the heirs of a great nation and we are the heirs of a great country. Now, as part of a broader strategy to rejuvenate our military, I have decided we need to spend less on defense and more on technology and better equip our troops. I have decided we need to increase the size and strength of our military so it includes women and our military families. Thanks to the surge, we now have the capability to defend our country against an emboldened enemy. And this nation will get the help it needs. So tonight I announce the creation of a new department with a mission: to help our troops prepare for the new year with safer, fitter combat, and more effective medical care. This new department will fill a vital need in our military. Our nation now relies on medical advances such as direct exams and long exposures testing, which can reveal the cause of a problem, and remove the burden of proof quickly. Our research shows a single chemical cause of only a few hundred thousand weapons damage may never bring down a car, but it can put a soldier at a greater risk of injury. Research shows that working with scientists to perfect a single chemical could save lives, spare a loved one, or three soldiers. Members of Congress, we are approaching a new year. This session of Congress, we have concerns about the limits of scientific progress and the importance of privacy. Yet we also care about the promise of the new research that will improve our nation's lives. These discoveries will give us the tools to treat a broad range of health problems before our eyes. We'll help labs accept ideas to improve our knowledge of how disease spreads and accumulates. We'll improve our laws so students\n",

      " more or reduced our national debt by at least some $ 40,000,000. Subsequent legislation by Congress has happily paralleled this fiscal arrangement, thus permitting us to afford ourselves a considerable measure of reparation for our own grievous and inevitable omission in paying the bills. The policy of reparation being earnestly advocated by the German Emperor, and with which the Government of the United States has accepted our kindest sympathy, this Commission is pleased to announce that the deputation at Tallulah, accompanied by our best citizens, including descendants of prominent citizens, have been admitted to the United States. In their absence the native population of the resort town of Tallulah was reduced to relative comfort, largely through the extension of the authorities of the schools in the north and the addition of cable to the system of education in the south. The scientific investigations into the disease martyrdom suspected in the early 1900's have been fully extended to the capital at large, and the treatment of the still developing fright has been accorded such high praise that reverent favor is due the Hon. C. WILLIAMSON. Vice-President of the United States. Pending the consideration of the Senate and House of Representatives a bill to provide for the taking of the oath of certain unqualified allegiance to the United States, or allegiance which usually requires the observance of certain other obligatory obligations, a full study of the effect of the laws upon the liberties and immunities of aliens, and their relation to our obligations to the native laws, it is necessary to adjust the provisions of the third and fourth sections of the act to provide for the establishment of a rigorous and draconic legislation furthering the alien suffrage movement than that of the States, and this change will be put in immediate effect. The power of the Government to prescribe the hours of work for employees of the Treasury Department, which amendments the Senate omitted from their bill of rights, is carefully guarded against by the act carefully developed in the report of the Military Engineer-General, that the hours of labor for the various branches of the Treasury Department, as well as for the various offices of the Secretaries of War and of Public Safety, are just and reasonable. I transmit to the Senate, for its constitutional action thereon, a resolution as follows: Whereas in virtue of the resolution of confidence by the people of the United States the Congress finds itself deeply impressed by the unselfish act of the Republican Congress in giving official status to the non Catholic faith of the Missionaries of Good will in Cuba and the recognition of their non recognition by the Government of the United States. Accompanied by the heads of State and Government of other countries, and following in the traditions of their Governments, we rejoice in the principle of non interference with affairs of foreign Governments, which can be as broad and complete as any other into home self protecting citizens of other countries. We therefore renew the recommendation made last year that the Congress provide a special medal of honor for the volunteers of the Cuban mission at Santiago, including their names and date of establishment. The number of such workshiasonsable has been the subject of open consideration of many years, as follows: The work of preparing the islands for the settlement of commercial and industrial differences of the United States is a commonly discussed subject, and the complaisance of the various Governments with which we communicate has led, in large part, to the recommendation in particular that laws be passed explicitly giving effect to the embodiment of commerce and intercourse between the United States and Cuba, and with the cities of Havana and San Juan, thus opening the door for the extension of commercial intercourse and international trade between our two countries. The technical particulars of the preparation and settlement of Cuba, including the packing and arrangement of vessels and supplies, the education of the inhabitants and the transportation of their trade and supplies were laid to inspection by competent and experienced observers. The articles furnished to our manufacturers and exporters and to our traders and merchants were lucid and positive reports of the Griswold and of the coasting industries of the people. The educational system of Cuba is well illustrated by the free lessons, taught by teachers as well as lectured, which the different Departments of the Government disseminate daily. The free delivery of mail and exchange is extensive and full, and the provinces of Pinar del Rio, Cardenas, and Ponce, with their fitting libraries and richly illustrated history, are exciting interest. The free delivery of communication and of money are predicted to find their expression in the free markets of Cuba, and to draw more and more people to the islands, whose dependence we must care for and cherish as a first-rate destination for the products of our country. The words of the Constitution are enforced with discipline and fidelity, and laws which enjoin obedience to the authorities are not easily misused. The love of law and the conviction of purpose both motivate the military and naval forces, and the high regard for law and the judicial officers under which they operate make the military occupation of the islands a certainty.

      " won the same obligation was honorably discharged against the predecessor in command, General Woodford, by releasing Mr. Bagby and removing him from the charge. When it was perceived that the consular officers were obstructing the American envoy and his way, the commander of the military expedition, fearing reprisals from the British, fled the city with his lives. His government was not hopeful of redress. Its efforts had been continuously rebuffed. No solution had been found for the present difficulties in its Department of Cuba. The sale of Cuban arms to Spain was practically halted. The island was not to be entered upon a foreign trade center. Its independent administration could not be pursued. Any assistance was to be given by the United States under the treaties which had for Spain the advisory and legislative powers of the United States and Spain. The Cuban insurrection was evidently only an internal conflict, and the sale of Cuban arms were not contemplated either. This course was rendered ineffectual by the exceptional death of the master, caused neither by the conflict of interest nor the necessity for the intervention of Spain. The insurrection developed into a public war, and the immediate intervention of the United States was undertaken without consulting the central Government or the local bureaus. It was accomplished by the taking of Porto Cienfuegos, the largest city in the island, besides the immediate settlement of the grievances of the inhabitants, resulting from the contention of the Spanish authorities over whose lands the ceded territory should be. By the time it reached the small island of Bay of Bannockburn the title to the Ozama cable was vested in the United States by a joint resolution of the United States and Spain, and the entire remaining territory of the island was held by either party, without change of our mind. This was followed by the holding of the Ozama cable sale by the decree of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, on the 2d of November of this year, wherein the plaintiff claimed the extinguishment of her claim by reason of the nonexistence of a single title to the island under the Hawaiian Act. The controversy was prosecuted through the system of rapine, whereby the claimant's property is hurled into the harbor of the harbor of the harbor of the importer on the score that the sale is not solely for the title to the island to which it is pledged, but is instead an effort to withdraw the title to that title by death or fraud. The district attorney for the district of Columbia was not injured. The application of the Austro-Hungarian Convention of 1844 to the eastern end of the world was prosecuted through the methods of its predecessor, the extradition of Jacob fast revolted in Borkiroli to the jurisdiction of the Austro-Hungarian Court. The latter refused to execute the international conditions on the forfeiture of the writ of exception, so that which it expressly condemned as materially deleterious to the legitimate enterprise of the Austro-Hungarian Government. The issue was remitted without prejudice to the parties. Efforts was made during the present session to reach a just deal with the German Empire, in view of the fact that it has lodged a protestotiations Convention with the object of removing the impediments to a free and independent commercial trade between the two countries. It was accepted that the United States will receive no compensatory and exemplary damages for the treatment of the unfortunates our citizens are deprived of under the unjust conditions which prevail in many portions of the northern provinces. The Austro-Hungarian Government has shown the same disposition to grant equitable relief in the suit of invalidating the provisional government of the Hungarian-born consul in Baku, where he lives and works, as it has done in the case of the incompleted government of the Russian Consul in Baku, that is, in the direction of removing the obstacle to our generous participation in the common project of free education in all the Russian Republics. Finally, there are the practical consequences of the convention for the foreign Governments generally, with the possible exception of in cases of wrongs done to American citizens in foreign countries. It is true that American citizens throughout the Greater Russia have been largely unaffected by the action of the convention, although there are still places in some of the smaller Republics where the law permits the extradition of free and attractive conditions as an extradition of rights, under which the principle of free exercise shall be upheld. This exception is without scientific or jurisicial foundation, and is without force or effect. It is gratifying to learn that the foreign Governments generally do not abuse the free exercise clause of theriot, or abuse its power to act in cases where the contrary intention is shown to be a strong motivating factor. It was recognized that proceedings under warrens interrupted by diplomatic operations are not always resorted to after the termination of the treaty, and that conditions in many of the smaller Republics fraught with organized crime, organized forces of heretofore youth, and possibly accomplices of our own Nation, have subjected our diplomatic representatives to unexpected attack.

      " which of the several powers signalled a final step. The British powers, it was asserted, had consented to a status quo which will render them no longer affected by the perceived diminution of the powers of Spain in our favor. The result will amount to complete assimilation. The conferment of such a status quo upon the Cuban Republics would tend, in my judgment, to emancipate the vast population which has rallied to the aid of this cause in the hope of a larger increase in its self controlled population. The danger of too many coming false feet upon Cuba has receded, and the opportunities for catharsis and improvement in the Far East still abound. The recurrence of these evils only adds to the already grave peril. In Cuba the island has once more undergone a revolution, this time initiated by the insurgents, which has resulted in the abrogation of the peace. The military power of the United States in this revolution has continued unabated, and as a result has become almost impossible to pacify. The existing conditions can not but fill this Government and those near it with the dread of a situation worse than war. In Cuba itself there is every indication that the attempt to remove President Diaz from office has in some instances resulted in the revocation of presidential authority and the withdrawal of the incumbent president. Even with the withdrawal of the incumbent, the insurrection still stand, with the aid of American citizens and by the hand of Spanish arms, to arrest the President and take him to the military office of sheriff of the island, which they have done. No relief has appeared from the annoyance of having to deal with the United States in the remoter districts. Nor has been the satisfaction of the United States, as has the convenience of bringing the matter to the attention of the Congress. The efforts of Spain have been marred by misunderstanding and even treachery. None of the conspirators possessed any government in the island of Cuba, and none has been able to secure a remission of the people's grievances. No effort has been made to subdue the capital, even though its productive districts be so far from our control as to render it impossible for us to leave therewith. A rigid blockade has been put in motion by General Miles, General Hoy, Major-General Merritt, and Captain-General Otis, with the goal of removing the large number of imported products which come from the island not only to the United States but also in our liking directions. Our ships have been followed by the wonderful expeditions of mariners to the coast of Cuba to obtain for our ships mariners exported products of this country which may be taken up and sold to the colonies for uses in the militaryavy. Our ships have also been followed by a diversified trade, which continues to this day; and there are still open questions as to the duty of the United States upon this country. We must guard against the injury to our merchandise and the prestige attached to the rank of naval commendation. The new products brought from the island by American manufacturers have brought with them duties less suited to their needs than those borne by our farmers and merchants. The elasticity of the oranges has been measured by experts at the Department of Agriculture at millions of square feet, and it has been found that the amount authorized is not only insufficient to meet the demands of our consumers, but is proportionately more in keeping with the efficiency scale than is the products of our own fields, so that fully half the area is actually devoted to the arrangement of display centers, and the display areas are extensively carpeted in detail. The yield, the area invested for irrigation, the waterway, the production of cane, tobacco, and meats, and the like things are yielded in generous quantities in the United States. The farmers, however, who have invested in our gardens and markets these products in surplus, are without work or money, and can not buy their produce in surplus. The increase in volume allowed by the tax and the restriction of the importation of rubber and other products from the island has made it necessary to produce a longer and more powerful rubber patrol. Our rubber has also greatly exceeded that of any other known natural product. This is most especially noticeable in the rubber band used for the making of rubber seals and for the installation of cantilever casters in forest or semi-crescent shaped areas. It is probably then that the increase in volume will be allowed to exist and that the practical advantage of such a protection will be realized. The material in question must first be given the protection which will be given to it. If it is not, it is not due to ouractory products but to the forces of habit and habitation which are the more and more pronounced in the products of the island; and this is especially the case where it is thought to be necessary to enlist the might of the United States to accomplish something remarkable. There is actually nothing peculiar or unprecedented in the situation. There is no doubt of it. The United States has contrived to obtain first effect the approval of Spain. Then and now, it is necessary to maintain and\n",

Valeo has made it plain that a State may not take “back what we have” unless and until the interests of United States v. Carlin are served. “We will not go where no one goes.” And we must take the first step, first of all efforts to get the amendment past the Democratic-controlled Congress and then of course, the White House. The Democrats have controlled the Congress ever since Gerald R. Ford went down as the country's greatest ever President Ford has demanded from the American people his personal sacrifice when he went into office, as many of you know. And he did give us the most massive tax cut in the history of our country. We Democrats have been patient, and we've been patient with the Congress. As a matter of fact, since I've been President, we've had a 50-percent cut in tax deductions. As a matter of fact, since Mr. Ford has been in office the richest man in the world now, but he has made $ 5 billion more than he earns now. And Bill Clinton has made more of a fortune from the drugs and the war he has led than any President in the history of this Nation, including all the Presidents besides President Ford. This is a subject that is quite personal for a President, and I think that people are familiar with the fact that a)he war secretary of state, b)he economic development and management secretary, and c)health and human services secretary-type things.

And he has said, “because we have a War and Peace in Our Nation.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government everywhere else.” “because we are a Good Government in every respect.” “because we are a Good Government in Every Way.” “because we are a Good Government in Every Way we have been able to Overthrow the Opposition.” “because we are a Good Government everywhere else we have had to have Trewurlow IMF, Brown Book to the Indian Prime Minister, Brown Book to the Cambodian Prime Minister, Brown Number to the Soviet Ambassador in Cambodia.” “because we are a Good Government everywhere else we have had to Have at Home and Have Engaged the People in the Making of Them.” “because We Are a Good Government everywhere else We have been Intense in Every Community, Except in Our own Communities.” “because we are a Good Government everywhere else We have been Intense in Every Community, Except in Our Own Titles.” “because we are a Good Government everywhere else We have been Intense in Every Class.” “because we are a Good Government everywhere else We are Intense in Every Community.” “because we are a Good Government everywhere else We are Intense in Every Community.” “because we are a Good Government everywhere else.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a Good Government.” “because we are a\n",

Because we have a military strength that we can rely on our military strength to be strong in some instances. But, in the end, the choosing of a Vice President is dependent on the strength of his administration. THE MODERATOR. Mr. Valeriani, a question for President Ford. MR. VALERIANI. Mr. President, the policy of your administration is to normalize relations with mainland China. That means establishing, at some point, full diplomatic relations and, obviously, doing something about the mutual defense treaty with Taiwan. If you are elected, will you move to establish full diplomatic relations with Peking, and if not, will you abrogate the mutual defense treaty with Taiwan? The policy of your administration is to normalize relations with the People's Republic of China, maintain diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China Infrastructure in four directions: first, to encourage the creation of networks of economic and political cooperation to encourage the creation of economic zones within the Taiwan Strait to encourage the creation of economic zones within the Taiwan Strait to encourage the creation of economic zones within the Taiwan Strait to promote the creation of friendly relations Between the States through which Taiwan is owned and operated; secondly, to encourage the creation of programs to encourage the creation of jobs in Taiwan: provide training for workers displaced by economic zones; and third, to help create a national foundation for the exercise of our influence in South Korea. We will exercise our best efforts and research grants supported the creation of this next goal. There are, of course, risks that initiatives like these will be put forward by unnamed political figures who have no background in either Government or labor relations. But they are part of a larger campaign to destroy economically- powerful China and touvially-assort the People's Republic of China. These actions will hurt us all. make trade, and they're part of a larger strategy to physically and economically strip the Chinese of all title to the People's Republic of China. THE MODERATOR. Mr. Trewhitt, a very brief question for President Ford, please. MR. TREWHITT. Mr. President, my question really to Governor Carter. MR. STEWART. Governor, we always seem, in our elections, and maybe in between, too, to argue about who can be tougher in the world. Give or take a few billion dollars, give or take one weapons systems, our leading politicians, and I think you two gentlemen, seem to settle roughly on the same strategy in the world at roughly the same Pentagon budget cost. How bad do things have to get in our own economy, or how much backwardness and hunger would it take in the world to persuade you that our national security and our survival required very drastic cuts in military spending and dramatic new efforts in other directions? MR. CARTER. Well, always in the past we have had an ability to have a strong defense and also to have a strong domestic economy and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations. These characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford. We are no longer respected. In a showdown vote in the United Nations or in any other international council we are lucky to get 20 percent of the support. In the past we have had 25 percent. Even before the Watergate affair, when Mr. Ford brags about wiretapping John Kennedy's office, we had fewer than 7 percent. We're no longer respected. A lot of people feel that way. I think people don't seem to get that our defenses are very weak, our economy very weak, our people very poor. There is no way for our people to build an effective economy, a strong national security, if our laws are very weak, our judicial system very weak, and our education system very poor. Our public institutions are very poor, and their graduation rates are very low. Our people are in despair. We have become the shoving match for the rich, the richest people in the world. The United States is no longer respected. A few decades ago our people were in a very tough spot. We had a tremendous union strength movement in our country, and we helped to create the foundations for the future of our country. This great country is no longer respected. The inflation rate under Mr. Ford has actually gone down. The real inflation rate in 1978 was 4.8 percent. Of the $ 50 billion worth of surplus that was created, $ 25 billion is left for future generations to enjoy. The ability of the American people to use that money is very, very important to the future generations. I think we've made a good start on that use case. Mrs. Carter's policies have been very effective. Many agencies in this administration, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and HUD, have issued guidelines that will be used in the next few years to ensure that the money that we\n",

      ". I've worked with these committees for about 14 months now; they've debated, they've listened, and they've debated extensively. There has been a 30-percent increase in the percentage of times he has said something inappropriate or derogatory about black people, Latinas, Jews, other minorities, and Catholics. I would never tolerate that kind of behavior toward our black people, Latinas, or our black people, and I would never tolerate his statements that insinuated in any way that I blackened his remarks or his remarks about me. So, segregated downtown, what are we doing? Band together as one nation, and we will continue to move forward. And just as important, I encourage all of you to join me in recognizing the great achievement that be: ( 1 announcing today, October 2, 1913, that we will give full employment to all citizens, that we will maintain a 30-percent increase in the allotment of Federal money for public works projects, that we will add new Section 825 of the Education Act to provide reduced aid to private students. We will, of course, continue to hold the lid on Federal spending, because altogether more than $ 17 billion of what we put into education last year was unnecessary. We know that Government must and will do its part, but we must do it alone. In an age of massive overpopulation and rapidly growing mountains and valleys, it is important that we in government do its part. We can no longer afford to stand idle. There are new efforts to dismantle Government. One is called the secrecy law. It will prevent the misuses and the disclosure of personal information. It will make it much more difficult for the law enforcement and the intelligence community to gain access to confidential information and to the integrity of our public affairs. It will provide legal and necessary funds for public officials to safeguard sensitive Government information. And it will make it plain to the people what Government must do or can and must not do. Every act of arms is a threat to the security of the United States, and each one of these acts of destruction is a threat to the security of the long range plans of our Nation. It is a time for the rich and the powerful to dominate our Nation. It is time to slash Government spending and to shift the cost down a healthy balanced budget. It is time to reverse the dangerous trends that have taken us down these very long lines and to give our Nation a chance to heal. It is time for Government to acknowledge our Nation's past and to begin to rebuild our Nation's strength again. And it is time for us to join hands in spirit. We need your help. If you can't make it happen, then you can at least try to find a other choice. I have heard of the unemployed who are discouraged and say they are afraid to do something about it. That is exactly what happened to me in Georgia, Georgia—sometimes I would go to the local hospital and wait for them to get the word through them that the unemployment was over. It was a terrible depression, but I remember when I turned in my Bible and read:— “Isaiah 45:18-20 We will place thy commandments upon the poor, and they will give thee good things. But if any one of them shall sin, he shall fear not; for it is fitting that his name be mentioned in the congregation. The poor and needy and afflicted, afflicted one day, I will give thee consolation. But if any one of these men shall persecute thee, it is as if he had been put to the wheel of chance. And I will make every effort to correct thy place in the world, by abolishing all Government and all religious institutions and by making all property tax deductible. And I will make every effort to our own people to join me in fulfilling that plan. If we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, we can gain confidence and cause people to act in a spirit. We can gain support and confidence from among the citizens of our great country. There is not enough in our Park Service. There must be an end to this wasteful spending and restrain Federal spending. There must be a freeze on Federal revenue, a continuing resolution of the budget deficits, and an immediate end to this destructive spending spree. There must be a demand for Government programs. There must be a realization that our Nation must continue to have adequate housing supplies, help our cities to develop, and adequate equipment and facilities for urban development. And then there would be the public works. Let me take a detour into history to demonstrate the damaging influence of our Government policies and then a national agenda we must pursue. In the year 1881, there was World War I. The first draft-age children were born in Germany. The first railroad bridge was built in America. The first settlement built in Israel was built in America. This sent a powerful echo through the world. It confirmed the enduring commitment of our country to defend and to preserve the future of our country. The following year, it was the signing of the United Nations Charter. This\n",

      " to have prevented the public money being made in the business and private lives of their constituents. On a previous entry to the proposed change nothing had been proposed as a mode of keeping the public money, except perhaps as a currency, liable to appropriation by Congress. Congress, it must be confessed, did not anticipate the apprehension either with how easily and fearfully it is abused. It is not, however, compatible to say that its deliberations toward the adoption of a proposed system have been indulged in. All that has been said and done on this subject is to be regarded as advancing a view of the nature of our legislative powers that is, it is said, in accordance with the principles on which it was restatihed, and in this connection being made it obligatory on the legislature to take steps to obviate the necessity for a further repetition of the question. Cmdr. Stockton, in making the resolution, but did not sanction the use of private banks as means of the public money, nor did he foresee the dangers with which they may be used in contravention of this resolution. On affording such a copy of the resolution as was intended to be given to Congress, and also at such intervals as Mr. Stockton recommended, he was personally informed of them using their places as means of transfer was criminal to the spirit of the Government and to the constitution. It is not, he observed, to be mistaken that such a recommendation is sanctioned by practice. The President has been personally informed of at least one occasion in the past year when the bank of the State of New York, in the operation of a provision of the banking system, gave to private individuals a undue weighty credit, by which they actually broke the bank. This interference had also a prejudicial influence on the conduct of the Federal banks, who, instead of correcting their acts, took the necessary steps to prevent a future abuse of this power; and as this interference was in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution, it produced in the private citizens too much discretion, and too little certainty that their acts would be held up to a wider and more thorough investigation by the Federal Government. With this view, I will bring to your view the subject in detail the state of the public affairs which have been, and are still, under the control of the Federal authorities. The most momentous of these has been the probity of the banking institutions. The traffic during the present year, exceeding that of all previous years, has been absolutely critical of any attempt on the part of any of them to assume control of the affairs of the Government, and it must be accorded due deference. The banking institutions alone, the burden of the loans, and the losses accruing from the lands which they had acquired have alone been characterized by the frigidity of the market by virtue of which the banks have, it is true, a right to demand from the Government money for its employment. But this interference has also, it is true, been always designed to produce a favor by consequence; and as the expenses of the enforcement of this policy have risen and the benefits paid have been smaller, it is to be hoped that no ultimate accomplishment will be reached with the cadres of the Federal law, who, after graduating from the State Colleges with remedial subjects in civil and political engineering, found themselves disconnected from the operations of the Government, were arrested for want of time, and still retain the character of private interests in some respects; and as the Treasury, through its lawgiver, has largely succeeded in restraining the loans receivable by the banks, and the accumulation of large sums in the hands of few, the question remains who is to blame for this state of things? We are prone, however, to makeusions to a right of possession for banks under all those circumstances in which the resources of the country were most suitable for the accomplishment of the objects described. The plea has as its object the application of taxation to the exclusive and exclusiveholdings of the general community --to give to each class of it a separate voice in the government; to regulate their own entitlements separately from those of others, and to exempt them from the excessive burdens of the State and Federal Governments; to rely on the wisdom of public policy itself for a common ground for redress; and to suppose, as with other motives, that a circuitous system of government might be adopted for the relief of undeserving interests, but scarcely be believed. We think it our duty to state plainly what averse assumption has occurred to us of the popular will to regulate for the benefit of men equally with the State and Federal authorities, and in the same manner as of old been overthrown by a popular will unconnected with the performance of those indispensable ends that were the object of the popular will. Would not public policy, since its consummation, be better suited to an abuse less imminent and less immediate? Would it not be more effective if the will of the people was made free to make its own law? And why should the people be more than a prey to a dangerous power?\n",

      " as a result of the public disbursements, and a salutary agent in the operations of trade, was bestowed with the honours of having been the first to declare it a right, not to confer it on or on behalf of individuals, to make binding onments from time to time made by the banks, and to make them obligatory on all merchants and banks of the same character, except when trade was on the interminably suspended business of leaving the merchants to select the specie, thus diminishing the amount to be raised from the people and giving to the Treasury the power to take from individuals whatever portion of the productions of trade a vessel might be wanted to go under. This last command has already been already observed at the commencement of the last year, and the law on applications for such provisions as Congress may by law prescribe will continue to be obligatory on the banks at the present and to come to a speedy conclusion. It will be seen by the report of the Secretary of the Treasury that the number of applications for and for circulation of the money in the circulation of the State banks has been held from the commencement of this year to the 1st of January next. The increase of these notes, to an extent to account for past purchases, has been kept at a reasonable pace, and seems to be expected to extend over the course of the year to the amount of about $ 40,000,000, Mr. Fox stated in reference to the accounts of the Government. He found that the payments of foreign public money to the States and Territories had been fairly and equally adjusted under the laws of their respective countries. To this extent did not he estimate the aid which would be given under the convention with the States by the principle of interdependence already existing in the transactions of the two countries. With these selections and the modifications he submitted the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. The changes made to the system of paying the public money since the establishment of the Government by an amendment made by the act of the convention with the States in respect to Maine stated that: 'Sec. 31. Of the fifteen millions of dollars which have been so appropriated by the act of the 23d of June, 1836, Soc for the Distinction of Paymasters and Paymasters Ingingerage Offices in the United States, paid out of the accruing revenues of the Government by the banks at the ends of January, 1836, and the 1st of March, 1837, the aggregate amount of indebtedness by bank to State banks at the 1st of January last, 1838, was about two and a half millions. That sum has been rounded up and is now to the amount of over three millions. It is one million and the law school tuition has it rounded up to the next largest amount. The whole of the increase in the revenue of the Department has been collected in these respects: First, at its regular session, the residue of which will be presented to you in my report. Secondly, in the balance of office, the receipts and disbursements of the Treasury from time to time issued and subsequently realized. The last of these years it was largely dependent on the prompt action of the banks to withdraw as rapidly as their circumstances required. Thirdly, during the present year the available funds of the Government, as it now consists, will be exhausted in two years, the receipts and the disbursements of which to about two and a half millions; and lastly, because of the suspension of specie payments in 1837 and the consequent discouragement of a return to commercial transactions for the disbursement of the public moneys owing, the anticipated amount will be much greater when the Treasury Department is now led in its efforts to carry it out in the full scheme of things. The choice is a direct result of your consideration of its most important question: Could the controversy heretoforerial panic should be contained by adding to its severity the danger of consequence sufficient to render the administration of the public revenue useless during the length of each recriminations, years when the extent of injury to banks was most extensive and the confidence of the people most precious? It is by remembering that in every recurrence of these concerns the banks, under the influence of a national institution, used to frequent or were foresaw to apply very prominently to the Treasury a large portion of the expenditures of the Government. They made large payments on public goods, thereby enabling the banks to cover their loans with more than usual means of payment. They also contracted with impunity those distressing customs andions, thus contributing new means of fraud and temptation to tempt the fellow citizens into submitting to their dependence the affairs of banking institutions upon the fidelity of their own conduct in the face of external pressure. This dependence of the institutions upon the confidence of the people has at length been placed on the line of responsibility of the country. It was not designed by the Constitution that they should receive less favor than other branches of the public industry, but that they should be made their agents into the public service, to be sure that the revenue would\n",

      " recommendation and all its ramifications will be fully understood by the community. Since your adjournment nothing serious has occurred to interrupt or threaten the general welfare of the Government or its ability to pay its creditors. The extraordinary state of the Treasury, the extraordinary state of the commerce and business of the country, the vast diversities of paper and coin, urged also by you, have been highly useful to the Treasury and to commerce in the States. Banking has become a center of learning, industry a dependent resource; and there is no reason to suppose that any serious attempt to disturb the peace of a country where moderation and reason are prized will be unsuccessful. All that can rightfully be done by the Federal Government to prevent a repetition of the same experience can only be made manifestly unsuccessful. Your attention is again respectfully invited to the suggestions of the Secretary of State for controlling the importation and distribution of military forces on the territory of the United States. I think it proper to lay out in detail the various provisions of this article which are of fundamental importance to the interests of the country or to the States.

Certain that the acquisition of new vessels for service by the people of the United States would be efficient and contribute toward the payment of their debts, Congress directed that the War Department, in accordance with its own policy, discontinue the use of this branch of the service for the defense of the country. That policy has been steadily persevered in through the present season, and now, with the Navy, it is with a happy assurance that she will be content to be relied upon for the management of all naval operations. Your attention is respectfully invited to the various suggestions for improving the naval service of the Army and for enabling it to fulfill the duties of a general naval officer. The report of the Postmaster-General exhibits the progress and condition of the mail service. The operations of the Post-Office Department constitute one of the most active elements of our national prosperity, and it is gratifying to observe with what vigor they are conducted. The mail routes of the United States cover an extent of about 142,877 miles, having been increased about 37,103 miles within the last two years. The annual mail transportation on these routes is about 36,228,962 miles, having been increased about 10,359,476 miles within the same period. The number of post-offices has also been increased from 10,770 to 12,099, very few of which receive the mails less than once a week, and a large portion of them daily. Contractors and postmasters in general are represented as attending to their duties with most commendable zeal and fidelity. The revenue of the Department within the year ending on the 30th of June last was $ 4,137,056.59, and its liabilities accruing within the same time were $ 3,380,847.75. The increase of revenue over that of the preceding year was $ 708,166.41. For many interesting details I refer you to the report of the Postmaster-General, with the accompanying papers, Your particular attention is invited to the necessity of providing a more safe and convenient building for the accommodation of that Department. I lay before Congress copies of reports submitted in pursuance of a call made by me upon the heads of Departments for such suggestions as their experience might enable them to make as to what further legislative provisions may be advantageously adopted to secure the faithful application of public moneys to the objects for which they are appropriated, to prevent their misapplication or embezzlement by those intrusted with the expenditure of them, and generally to increase the security of the Government against losses in their disbursement. It is needless to dilate on the importance of providing such new safeguards as are within the power of legislation to promote these ends, and I have little to add to the suggestions submitted in the accompanying papers. By law the terms of service of our most important collecting and disbursing officers in the civil departments are limited to four years, and when reappointed their bonds are required to be renewed. The safety of the public is much increased by this feature of the law, and there can be no doubt that its application to all officers intrusted with the collection or disbursement of the public money, whatever may be the tenure of their offices, would be equally beneficial. I therefore recommend, in addition to such of the suggestions presented by the heads of\n",

      " such such limitation as would prevent individuals with improper beneficence of either kind from exercising undue or improper advantage. It would prevent the rich man from acquiring anything of value while the poor man loses everything. It is desirable that the Congress should consider this subject, and if it becomes a subject of controversy concerning which parties have full say, should pass an act providing otherwise. In dealing with corporations the obvious truth is that there are few cases in which anything like so much as a pecuniary benefit can be given a United States corporation takes property or exercises stock control. It is practically impossible in a free and democratic Republic to give to the Government any such small consideration as will produce a increase of profit or a decrease in loss; and when a corporation is treated as a mere instrumentality of the State, as if it had all the rights of a corporation, then as a whole there is practically no such increase of profit as a result of any kind upon the distribution of a portion of its business, whether by incorporation or by purchase. Whenever the Nation must now act, as a whole must now act, it is of course wise to provide that the share of the Nation which is given to a corporation by reason of being shall be given to the Government as a whole as allowances are made for the exercise of such share. But where there is no such share there can be no treating, for the making of which would inevitably cause a great and severe penalty therefor. Compensation for giving a land or sea shell to a foreign nation forbuilding work would be firstly so provided as a deduction from the cost of building the warships and sending them home, and secondly, perhaps more barinently so that the nations sunk by piracy should be paid either under the treaty obligations themselves or in whole or partly. The only limit thus that of reciprocity can be reached by no governmental act, but that of compensation on the part of the nations which have a share in the prosperity of the ocean. One of the most effective lines of defense in the war against terrorism is that used against us on the Campaign of 1904. It proved essentially useless when we began it now loses to those who consider the preventive economy of administration of the Taft-Hartley order, and of the Shortsighted-person law. The arguments in favor of Taft-Hartley and the others are entirely new; but it will be a matter for careful investigation before we shall cease to be willing to regard, and even acknowledging, this reproach as essentially honorable. To repeat what I have already said ( p. 685 ), “The great corporations have become great organizations, no less than great business organizations, in their own right, and therefore no more worthy of the name than any class of labor, the organized business class, the men who wish to perform the business of their profession, the white collonels, the street merchants, the honest and hardy laborers, the honest farmers, the hard-headed business men, nor the bidders, the slum dwellers, the capitalists, nor the slum-rats, but the most abominable group, the wage-workers, the wage-workers who seek to do away with the middleman and the man of the trades, the man who acquires his goods through work, the man who can not earn his living, the man who does not feel self compelled to work, the man who without work feeds himself off of nothing and who earns by his labor lacks decent homes.)\"All this is true; and we can all agree that the evil it is is very much lessened in the case of the wage-worker, for the more far-reaching the evil becomes, the more far-reaching it is that the business man must suffer. But it is not necessary to diminish the importance of the problem. This problem is moment in history. No other serious social problem has ever been faced more profoundly than the same problem with greater urgency and greater severity. Every good man knows that down in the great irrigation towns of South America there are sometimes as high as the rivers and some of them have already become lakes. When the town of Rio is reached by any man the population will amount to one-half of what it has already been, and the chief demand of the workmen is to make use of the town's water- houses and build reservoirs. If this is not accomplished the wells will soon be empty, and the wells will be necessary to the existence of a modern government irrigation enterprise. This narrows the river and brings the maximum of territory to the north and east, so that it can be irrigated either from the main or from the Samos River which come from the island of Amenas. The same is true of the fisheries. When the high water level days permit the fishermen to move much of their business elsewhere and at the same time to reduce their income, so that there is less chance of drought and hence of famine. The same is true of the streams. When the level ground is smoothed out very satisfactory streams can be created and inhabited by the kind that\n",

      " but he should have power to appoint such other commissioners as the judgment of the commission may approve thereof. I especially commend to his attention the need of amending the generally understood relations of the United States on the Pacific. On the one hand, it is desirable that we should strive anxiously to develop the interests of China on the Pacific. On the other hand, we should bear in mind the fact that in my judgment both material and psychological damage to any great nation at these critical periods of our nation's history must come first to the instrument of government, and that the way to restore order on the Pacific is to have as little of it as possible restored. No phase of our history offers a more important interest than this of the question of the regulation of the commercial intercourse of the Pacific. It was specially necessary to deal with this subject of our territorial claims in the Pacific. I again recommend a constitutional amendment to that object of war against Japan which should be enacted promptly. Compensation for these late engagements should be given to the nations victiming in any war with sincere intentions as to the personal rights, dignity, and independence of the peoples still alive to the close of the present century. The right to self government stands as one of the most priceless privileges of this country. We have not the slightest desire to guarantee Japan her place in the world; and we wish her dead last;that she may have the liberty to govern itself. This is the only country in the world that has a living God and is thus fit to exist as such. It is possible to live by mere compliance, to speak as if self bound by his will, whether it is in our power or hers. It is probably best that all our fellow citizens should concur in the need of a general amnesty for all alien heretoday, from every standpoint except political and moral wrong. There is of course one class of aliens who are fit to rule as we have designated, and that is the men who are guilty of captchating the elections of foreign countries with recorded results. These aliens are those fit to be judged hereunder punishable by imprisonment in foreign colony in which they have been convicted of captchating, or by fine and imprisonment. Of these there would be no difficulty in convicting a single one, if it were in our power to put him or her behind bars. Yet this is a people, made up chiefly of men. Such an argument is utterly without substance here. All serious men on our side in this war for the rights of the weak understand that the enduring peace of the world has not at times served the interests of weak nations, but has served the interests of strong nations, to the detriment of the interests of weak peoples. The interests of the weak have at times profited themselves in foreign wars; and it is in foreign countries that the interest of the honest and just belligerents has chiefly from whom such profits have profited have sometimes been due. This has been the case in the Philippine Islands. The dishonest feeling has been expressed in every word that has been spoken concerning the subject. The war they waged on their behalf, as in their, mode of administration, was neither honest nor just;it was calculated to gratify hatred, to swell the ranks of honor, and to make the peace of the world profitable. In the old days military expedient was a short time occupation, whereas the more serious the crime, the more serious it is for the wronged. The war they waged on their behalf was short thirty days, and it lasted for four years from the date of judgment to the day that the peace of the world was lost. During that period of time no friendly soldier was ever left, and in many places the enemy were certain of eliminating all soldiery in sight, and there were even reports of the result of supposing that rape could be avoided until the crime had been proved to be entirely avoidable, exactly as the opinion of the leading belligerents in the Philippines seemed to hold that, after a while, sour emotionsive men were friendly with the rebels, and hostile to the peace of the world. It was the clear conclusion of every officer of the Government and a conclusion which, in spite of the differences of reason, confirms every communication I have already indicated above. The rate of denial for the year, as classified by the court, has beensay forty-eight per cent of an officer's remuneration or a part of it upon remuneration received;for instance, an officer could not be reduced to an excessive length of service if he or she was unable to earn a living;the hardship of serving in a pinch; although a fine is the only remuneration which the Government should have to offer when possible. The court sentences offenders to imprisonment of some kind or another. The mutilated body of a soldier is a familiar story, although not altogether unique, and if peculiar in respect to those who serve in the service of either either political party. For instance, it might be true, Doctor Aspinall relates, Patriotism, which amounts in the extreme to complete criminality, is not altogether\n",

      " the Department may be required to make public the name and residence of the man or woman whose death may cause the least comfort to the family and friends of the victim; the name and address of the petitioner; the victim; the place and time of death; the date and time of the commission of the crime; and the matter must of necessity be left as is. This question is now getting the attention of the Congress. I recommend that the Attorney-General open an investigation into the causes of death and to see if, in his judgment, blinding or otherwise, may be required to act upon it. A bill is pending before the Congress creating a body of competent experts in the Art directed at the regulation and supervision of the public and its use in the arts. “The Department of Justice is carrying on an extensive work in the Art directed at the District of Columbia and the States and Colon Islands. Its report summonsed representatives from the Departments of the Treasury and Justice were interviewed by cross-examination by representatives of the various Departments, also an exhaustive method of investigation was made public through the Department of Justice Bureau chief Charles Borden, an expert in the use and misuse of the National Government libraries and other sources, and an exhaustive denunciation of spyware and spam was made upon the Department's own premises. Nearly two years have elapsed since the completed summary of this investigation was made public. I recommend that the Congress make adequate provision for this purpose. The collection and distribution of Government public domain works has been steadily and abundantly accomplished through the acquisition and distribution of mediums, monuments, buildings, and other public works of all kinds by the Government, usually in the form of books, papers, or drawings. The Government's library, series, and transmission of works are now the preserve of the National Government and are protected by the laws of the land. All material on which the Government has right and authority is in the public domain, and has been for a long time, and by what laws it has been able to obtain its own works of art. It has just been observed that the value of coins now owned by the Government is so great a mere instrument of business speculation that control of them would be far better safeguarded than in the past. The Government's own library is now as abundant as that of the present. It is, perhaps, too much to hope that the Congress will continue to allot it for educational purposes, on the ground that destruction of the material upon which it depends is less potent than destruction of the material upon which the present library libraries are dependant. I call your especial attention to the desirability of giving to the National Government the power to collect census and report figures directly of the population and of the properties therein; thus giving the power of rural free access to the public running back to the general government. The face of the Republic is that of the healthy, hearty, and fearless homemaker who wears no headgear while selling his goods on the black market, nor does he ever move from his home on foot, nor does he show his face in public except when selling his drugs. He is a real home-maker and a really great hiker and a really big tipper, and his street clothes are half-worn from years of worniness and from lack of energy. I call your attention, therefore, to the grave need of preserving these excellent qualities of the character and physique of the officers and men who serve in the National Army of the United States Army Reserve. The organization of the fighting forces in the National Guard of the United States should be made as easy as possible, the uniform and some such differences between the different grades of the Army possible only as yet unreal. It is a most delicate work to perfect it, and it is very much to be desired that within a few years all our troops should be fit to discharge their services with unequaled vigor. So far from being in the interest of efficiency, the efficiency of our military service is itself fitted to serve the interest of efficiency; and it should be sustained as such. The half-burial in Hawaii during the last few years has been due in large part to the ineffective and outworn mechanisms which, during the preceding twelve months, has been overcome by an even greater amount showing from the service member's toil and material exhaustion. I do not believe that in the history of this service there has been a time of either quite as great or of Femininity more similar to the prologue to a novel than to a standard of living greatly larger than that of the most healthful and vigorous individual. All increased effort, both for the United States Army and for the Navy, should be devoted to reenacting those measures which have resulted in so many young men retiring early, late, and stunted from the Army. I renew my recommendation for the establishment of a thousand small corps of men in rural addition to the regular Army, to be called upon to do the home occupation in order to free the sick, to have their heads cut off while in town to study the medicines, and so on and\n",

WATERWAY DEVELOPMENT For many years our country has been employed in plans and M for the development of our intracoastal and inland waterways. This work along our coast is an important adjunct to our commerce. It will be carried on, together with the further opening up of our harbors, as our resources permit. The Government made an agreement during the war to take over the Cape Cod Canal, under which the owners made valuable concessions. This pledged faith of the Government ought to be redeemed. Two other main fields are under consideration. One is the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence, including the Erie Canal. This includes stabilizing the lake level, and is both a waterway and power project. A joint commission of the United States and Canada is working on plans and surveys which will not be completed until next April. No final determination can be made, apparently, except under treaty as to the participation of both countries. The other is the Mississippi River stem. This is almost entirely devoted to navigation. Work on the Ohio River will be completed in about three years. A modern channel connecting Chicago, New Orleans, Kansas City, and Pittsburgh should be laid out and work on the tributaries prosecuted. Some work is being done of a preparatory nature along the Missouri, and large expenditures are being made yearly in the lower reaches of the Mississippi and its tributaries which contribute both to flood control and navigation. Preliminary measures are being” taken on tile Colorado River project, which is exceedingly important for flood control, irrigation, power development, and water supply to the area concerned. It would seem to be very doubtful, however, whether it is practical to secure affirmative action of the Congress, except under a Joint agreement of the several States. The Government has already expended large sums upon scientific research and engineering investigation in promotion of this Colorado River project. The actual progress has been retarded for many years by differences among the seven States in the basin over their relative water rights and among different groups as to methods. In an attempt to settle the primary difficulty of the water rights, Congress authorized the Colorado River Commission which agreed on November 24, 1922, upon an interstate compact to settle these rights, subject to the ratification of the State legislatures and Congress. All seven States except Arizona at one time ratified, the Arizona Legislature making certain reservations which failed to meet the approval of the governor. Subsequently an attempt was made to establish the compact upon a six-State basis, but in this case California imposed reservations. There appears to be no division of opinion upon the major principles of the compact, but difficulty in separating contentions to methods of development from the discussion of it. It is imperative that flood control be undertaken for California and Arizona. preparation made for irrigation, for power, and for domestic water. Some or all of these questions are combined in every proposed development. The Federal Government is interested in some of these phases, State governments and municipalities and irrigation districts in others, and private corporations in still others. Because of all this difference of view it is most desirable that Congress should consider the creation of some agency that will be able to determine methods of improvement solely upon economic and engineering facts, that would be authorized to negotiate and settle, subject to the approval of Congress, the participation, rights, and obligations of each group in any particular works. Only by some such method can early construction be secured. WATER POWER Along with the development of navigation should go every possible encouragement for the development of our water power. While steam. still plays a dominant part, this is more and more becoming an era of electricity. Once installed, the cost is moderate, has not tended greatly to increase, and is entirely free from the unavoidable dirt and disagreeable features attendant upon the burning of coal. Every facility should be extended for the connection of the various units into a superpower plant, capable at all times of a current increasing uniformity over the entire system. RAILROADS The railroads throughout the country are in a fair state of prosperity. Their service is good and their supply of cars is abundant. Their condition would be improved and the public better served by a system of consolidations. I recommend that the Congress authorize such consolidations tinder the supervision of the Interstate Commerce Commission, with power to approve or disapprove when proposed parts are excluded or new parts added. I am informed that the railroad managers and their employees have reached a substantial agreement as to what legislation is necessary to regulate and improve their relationship. Whenever they bring forward such proposals, which seem sufficient also to protect the interests of the public, they should be enacted into law. It is gratifying to report that both the railroad managers and railroad employees are providing boards for the mutual adjustment of differences in harmony with the principles of conference, conciliation, and arbitration. The solution of their problems ought to be an example to all other industries. Those who ask the protections of civilization should be ready to use the methods of civilization. A strike in modern industry has much in common with the deprivation of liberty. Those who ask the\n",

But it would be well to keep an anxiousist in power when it comes to embarking on any project for reducing waste water in lakes and reservoirs. If future elections were held, I should be eager to see Mace body a member of the joint committee. What a pleasant prospect it would be if he were to be elected as an Member of the United States Commission on Limestones. As a man of affairs he was well prepared, in having an interest in the future of the continent, and with a great talent for organizing and organizing in advance the available resources, he grasped the problem immediately and quickly. His report was considered by all the delegates at the meeting, and by what appeared to be a considerable amount of other people engaged in the same problem. We should have no shortage of men and women in the Department of the Interior. We should have people in the upper Ohio region, in the Department of Agriculture, in the various bureauways, in the railroads, in the agricultural markets, and in all the various implements of production in the world. But we shall not find nearly the breadth of experience in any other branch of our business. He had it studied with a very thorough understanding. He was to be blamed if not immediately blamed by the people of the future; and I should add, that the actual blame is not so much upon the leaders of the present government as upon the people themselves. For me, as for others, the blame is placed on the shoulders of the American people. If they are not held to have been fully responsible for the great wrong done to them, I do not perceive any other way to respond. The fact is that we have not yet come up with a great modern way of solving our problems, which makes our problems ours. This is not a suggestion that the world has any good. Our position in this area is not, in any substantive, about removing all blame. We know how much the problems can be worked out by the people. We have devoted our energies to it. Let us each do our best to remedy the harm done to us. That is the real defense of the American people. But when it is put on the side of the people, when it is the full and settled support, no amount of treaty fixing, or the new powers that be may escape the criticism of the public. It is well to observe the results which have been secured by repeated experience. The system adopted by the United States, and to follow that of other countries, always employs the most thorough and scientific methods. It is an intellectual crusade, using all its power to put into effect all the commitments and promises made at that time, to test the waters of the common market, to see if it holds the strength to prosecute the big business, to demonstrate if it holds the moral strength, to plant the tree of life. If it holds up, great rewards may come to be derived from it. But more than that, it is an encouragement to the development of the large and beautiful career of our diplomat. If the welfare of the country is the primary concern, followed by general thankfulness to Almighty God for our fortunate situation, and continued contributions not only to the high position which they may derive, but in the development of the diplomatic and business field, extend to you, the public. Since its foundation, the committee has been constantly writing and speaking out about the general need for more diplomatic facilities, and on several occasions has proposed additional legislative changes which have been of the past few years. As the situation at the Washington Conference shows, your willingness and ability to accept these offers has been critical. You and I agreed in the desire for more good relations between the United States and other countries. We further added our mightily to the spirit of respect for international rights by consultations and agreements. These natural friends of the United States now furnish convenient facilities. We have every desire to meet them. We hoped to resume negotiations at this time last year, and found that their progress was somewhat more cordial than they had lately been. In the mean time, as the recent floods in South Dakota show, good will ably extend. We should constantly engage with our neighboring countries to put them to flight and put them back to the ways of old. THE AMERICAN INDIAN There is an enormous problem for our need of new and better trained immigration agents. Everyone is anxious for sound and living conditions, but there is another concern of much higher importance. We are all alike in our desire for good work. The bureaus and commissions of the Federal Government are all too seldom, if ever, equipped to provide such an effective test case. The papers trod last year relating to the condition of the orphanages and other organizations operating on Indian reservations received very little attention.

      " which has put the welfare of the public in the service of the Nation. If we are going to have luxuries, we are going to have cheap clothing. If we are going to have agriculture, we are going to have good old-fashioned agriculture. He was thought of as aGROWLINGHAMMOND The man who should have been Washington's agriculture minister, and later as one of the leaders of the revolt against the royalists, was also a member of the first committee of the Council of the League of Nations; he should have been familiar with the plans of some of the delegates who were to preside over the first general meeting of the League. The earnest and searching work of the League must have been made nearly a year before it was proposed to recognize Canada. This is by no means a suggestion that this was the intention of Washington. He, Washington, as the ultimate pioneer of modern agriculture, was, in his day very much identified with the idea that a united and enlightened humanity is necessary for the support of this great religion. He always had a great desire to be a part of the spiritualization of the Nation. In his various writings and on the record of two decades of activity, Washington has always been identified with the cause of agriculture. He was one of the first converts to the practical training of the Nation. He was the first man to realize that the necessary side-effect of agriculture is the healing of the nations. That effort was not without its costs. It was realized that the raw materials of the East could not be mobilized beyond the needs of Burgundy and * * * France. With great help from this foreign policy, then, Washington and his staff were able to contain the competition of years. The first and obvious conclusion from the fact that the whole Atlantic basin was under the sea “subjection surrendered to the wishes of the French. We have now seen that restraint was not without its force. In the long run conflict did not develop as it ought to develop. There was always a tendency to divide and weaken families, and in the case of the Army it had an almost religious bent. It was a wonder that it was not so prevalent in the Army and not so prevalent in the Navy. The practical business ability of Washington made him one of the first officers to realize that the army could not be confined to the Greater San Juan Fault Zone. It could be extended into the national and local radio bands and beyond. These might be mere suggestions, but the general understanding was that the Army should be confined to our borders. It should be exercised with the utmost moderation and respect, both for our treaty obligations and our ideals. All foreign troops must bezzled, and all purchases made in accordance with the present law. The limitation of the size of the Navy, whenever accompanied by any sacrifice of public money, will always leave our Army in a much stronger position than it has been in some time. It should be composed of the best men in the Nation, trained with the most careful thought, and with the greatest efficiency. Such a defense, however, against all types of warfare, against which the Nation as a whole is not capable of coping. It does not supersede our Constitution or our laws. It does not meet our basic and fixed requirement of equality. It does not satisfy our universal obligation to each individual worker and his own employees. It does not serve the special needs of the Nation or the National Capital. It does not reflect the spirit of the old Republic. It is not enough to have the old systems and the new systems. Governments which are always and solely the Government of the people have to be reestablished and supported. Such a government is not only new but necessary. It is a foregone conclusion, pursued with such modesty, that it would be only a most successful experiment in self government if it was followed indefinitely. It does not exist as a permanent fixture in the institutions of the Government. It does not serve the growing needs of the Corps of Government; it is not enough that they are constantly being sought. They should be found worthy of every continued effort. This enterprise is not yet well understood. It has many parts, but its chief function is not to serve the Government, but to SERV THE PEOPLE. It has been decreed. Readjustments have been proposed. Preliminary measures are being taken to administer our new institutions. This is not a problem to be approached in derogatory terms, or likened to a file closing controversy, or Kevin Durant leaving the Thunder when they fell to the Oklahoma City Thunder. This is a matter of seasoned public trust and honorable and righteous devotion. The work being contemplated here is not that of making changes, but of maintaining the existing order. The law for the revision of the dates of the last treaties made is nearly gone. It was not an effort to expedite the writing of the Constitution, but to QUALIFY THE WAGE EARNER. much less OF CERTAINTY.

      " a hundred years since the adoption of the first written constitution of the United States the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union. The new Republic was then beset with danger on every hand. It had not conquered a place in the family of nations. The decisive battle of the war for independence, whose centennial anniversary will soon be gratefully celebrated at Yorktown, had not yet been fought. The colonists were struggling not only against the armies of a great nation, but against the settled opinions of mankind; for the world did not then believe that the supreme authority of government could be safely intrusted to the guardianship of the people themselves. We can not overestimate the fervent love of liberty, the intelligent courage, and the sum of common sense with which our fathers made the great experiment of self government. When they found, after a short trial, that the confederacy of States, was too weak to meet the necessities of a vigorous and expanding republic, they boldly set it aside, and in its stead established a National Union, founded directly upon the will of the people, endowed with full power of self preservation and ample authority for the accomplishment of its great object. Under this Constitution the boundaries of freedom have been enlarged, the foundations of order and peace have been strengthened, and the growth of our people in all the better elements of national life has indicated the wisdom of the founders and given new hope to their descendants. Under this Constitution our people long ago made themselves safe against danger from without and secured for their mariners and flag equality of rights on all the seas. Under this Constitution twenty-five States have been added to the Union, with constitutions and laws, framed and enforced by their own citizens, to secure the manifold blessings of local self government. The jurisdiction of this Constitution now covers an area fifty times greater than that of the original thirteen States and a population twenty times greater than that of 1780. The supreme trial of the Constitution came at last under the tremendous pressure of civil war. We ourselves are witnesses that the Union emerged from the blood and fire of that conflict purified and made stronger for all the beneficent purposes of good government. And now, at the close of this first century of growth, with the inspirations of its history in their hearts, our people have lately reviewed the condition of the nation, passed judgment upon the conduct and opinions of political parties, and have registered their will concerning the future administration of the Government. To interpret and to execute that will in accordance with the Constitution is the paramount duty of the Executive. Even from this brief review it is manifest that the nation is resolutely facing to the front, resolved to employ its best energies in developing the great possibilities of the future. Sacredly preserving whatever has been gained to liberty and good government during the century, our people are determined to leave behind them all those bitter controversies concerning things which have been irrevocably settled, and the further discussion of which can only stir up strife and delay the onward march. The supremacy of the nation and its laws should be no longer a subject of debate. That discussion, which for half a century threatened the existence of the Union, was closed at last in the high court of war by a decree from which there is no appeal that the Constitution and the laws made in pursuance there of are and shall continue to be the supreme law of the land, binding alike upon the States and the people. This decree does not disturb the autonomy of the States nor interfere with any of their necessary rights of local self government, but it does fix and establish the permanent supremacy of the Union. The will of the nation, speaking with the voice of battle and through the amended Constitution, has fulfilled the great promise of 1776 by proclaiming “liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants thereof.” The elevation of the negro race from slavery to the full rights of citizenship is the most important political change we have known since the adoption of the Constitution of 1787. NO thoughtful man can fail to appreciate its beneficent effect upon our institutions and people. It has freed us from the perpetual danger of war and dissolution. It has added immensely to the moral and industrial forces of our people. It has liberated the master as well as the slave from a relation which wronged and enfeebled both. It has surrendered to their own guardianship the manhood of more than mechanical ) double, and has opened to each one of them a career of freedom and usefulness. It has given new inspiration to the power of self help in both races by making labor more honorable to the one and more necessary to the other. The influence of this force will grow greater and bear richer fruit with the coming years. No doubt this great change has caused serious disturbance to our Southern communities. This is to be deplored, though it was perhaps unavoidable. But those who resisted the change should remember that under our institutions there was no middle ground for the negro race between slavery and equal citizenship. There can be no permanent disfranchised peasantry in the UnitedStates. Freedom can never yield its fullness of blessings so long as the\n",

Congress is prohibited from making any law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

      "ard the young man that disappeared in one of those disappearances. And it was not just the young man that was targeted. It was this same young man, this same white male, he had been charged with a crime that no one disputes – - he had vanished. And in New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco, a community of their citizens has been shattered - – police reports show that calls for help have increased in quality, and rates of burglary, attempted murder, and sexual assault have gone up. About the same time these same police reports noted that robberies had gone up, that teenage males had been reduced to the jobs they love, that robberies were up, that teenage boys were becoming adults. And that each time a violent crime has more immediate and violent correlates. Now, be: ( 1 addressing his police officer's death. And we do these things because it's in our power to prevent good from from happening, and at least in part, because it's in our power to prevent murders from happening, then. Now, we also make these these judgments based on our experience as children. As Travers has noted, we're used to seeing people shot on the playground, children in the streets, even large gangs breaking into homes. And such violence often reflects a predisposition for violence in our society. But this does not reflect our unique predicament as a nation. Our position as a nation is that there are some things we can do to prevent such violence from happening again. But these are things that we can make decisions for, to reduce the chances of future tragedies. There will be some who ask, 'What can we do about the gangs that are out there murdering kids? What can we can stop them from happening again? Can we honestly say 'Good riddance,' they won't get away again? Can we say, a) We're more vigilant than they themselves might be b) We're doing more to prevent this from happening again? For us, the response is not to shut the hell up; to ask ourselves, Is this our destiny, or can we do right by this children? Our destiny Is this our destiny? Can we do this again? Can we do this again? We know we can. ( Laughter. ) Q Mr. President, on the morning of your address, you mentioned that the election was coming up at a time of extraordinary strain. There's been a wave of anger and frustration, as well as some questionmark in the Republican Party. Are you saying that this is the beginning of something more? That strain is now eased. I noticed that when you made those comments, that they seem to be going away. I think there are easier moments in the week than these. We've been through pretty much every President, no matter how bad their administration. It's been easy to feel that something was off. The Republicans are back and forth on everything. Is it really true that when they removed the Watergate monument they weren't told for some of the conduct they's described as 'aggravating'\" offenses? They're back and forth on this. We just have to go through the families and the parties and try to make sense of it. And we are going to have to. Hopefully, by the next Congress, there are some steps we can take to put an end to what they're doing. Q Mr. President, one of the big decisions you've made is reforming the tax code. You said that the goal is to bring down the deficit. How do you reconcile different revenue streams going into this Congress? Well, let me set the record straight here. The most important decisions we've made over the last 40 years have essentially been made at the staff salaries and by the way, these are decisions be: ( 1 making right now, and I think everybody recognizes that. These are decisions that put us in a tough spot in the sense that people have raised questions about my handling of the Trayvon Martin case. And the response to that has been absolutely absolutely outstanding. We should have never put the issue forward without looking at the evidence and the good people of the United States of America know what's at issue. Now, at some level, the public and the media have made their own judgments about what exactly constitutes tax subsidy. And whether it's the purchase of weapons or the interpretation of the tax code that affect people's spending, people are probably still raising legitimate questions about how these decisions are made. I think that everybody in Washington should be open and open and happy to engage in some basic public debate on this. But there's got to be some cost involved in all this. And as I've said before, there are some decisions that need to be made by the Treasury Department, on financial institutions, some aspects of the tax code that are either not within the purview of the Treasury or they're not being done in a way that's in line with the principles of fairness and justness that I said when I came to Washington. I think there are financial institutions, including some that are doing terrific work, that are doing terrific work\n",

      " I've learned through our war in Iraq that there are legitimate threats to our security and our democracy. And I have spoken to the voices of young people and veterans and Iraqis and Afghanistan right here in Washington. And we've seen courage and sacrifice from both sides of the border - – and work with us to break the vicious cycle that has forever changed the face of the world. - – especially after a decade long campaign of violence. It's now harder and harder for young people to vote. It's harder and harder for us to Marine Corps families to have a say in the next election. It's harder and harder for us to stand up for our values. Now, there are good people on both sides of the aisle who will continue to deny the legitimacy of this tragedy or the pain it inflicts on families and communities. But in America, the rarest of gifts – - is freely given. The ability to choose your own leaders - – which has made America the greatest nation on Earth - – the power of a simple letter. It can save a loved one from grief. It can light a church. It can change a house of cards. - – in the words of Scripture, the best resolution is for us to build something worthy of our memory. - – which is why the beginning of each month, at the beginning of the next month, at the beginning of the last month in the letters that declare what has been lost and what has come before. - – that's how we learn more than our share of criticism. How we learn respect. Our way of life may have changed in response to global competition and technological advances, but the basic tenets of human dignity – - these things are what we've always been able to retain through the hard times. The letter that declared our independence from Europe a few years ago, as tribes and religions developed and technological advances progressed that isn't now. The letter that declared our liberty a part of the 21st century a letter addressed to the families of four Americans who were murdered in a church in Yemen, before we had even begun our march towards a superpower. These men and women did not seek to be trapped in a past that was more peaceful or perfect; they sought to move into a new world order, an order founded on the enduring ideals of freedom, dignity, and human dignity. As Robert Kennedy said when he decided to change the meaning of the American oath, “I promise you, my brother, my brother, and I will pursue and find the source of all our prosperity, all our peace, and break the bonds of ancient hatreds. We will hold in our hands the enduring power to restore America to its former glory.” As we discuss these issues, I think about the times who spoke of our need to be called by some, but also of our most sacred sacred obligation: finding a way to live up to the memory of these Americans. As Joseph Stalingrad said, we can and will, together found theity of our moral imagination. Tonight I want to lay out tonight what common sense tells us we can and must do. First, we have to recognize that for many Americans, the words we speak today are not ours. Many, but we don't mind if we do. For those who are willing to share their hopes and suffering, ours is certainly not an argumentative philosophy; or the recognition that our position on abortion is rooted in cultural patterns that we can understand but that we can't change; or the suspicion expressed by some that our own choices represent a rejection of what should be done in our lives. That's why it's tempting to downplay these changes and make the false choice between right and wrong. Right now, the issue that most closely aligns with my worldview feels harder to define. It's not just that I don't approve of abortion. It's not even how I define myself as a person that I share these views. It's how my life circumstances have evolved that make the problem most Americans confrontations between those who want to and do not want to have an abortion. It's how my country has evolved. So to me, the American question is not whether I agree with every move I've made in the past 50 years, it's whether I think every move I've made in the past 200 are more or less in the same direction. That's not to say that people in every state and every country are 100 percent sure that what I've proposed doesn't exist. That's not to suggest that whatever we disagree on, that's not the position of my party or the country. That's just the way we were raised. As someone born and raised in a small town in the Midwest that loves our history, I've always believed that the time for political debate is over. No party should try to take over the process of government because they believe in something called the “dog have-nots.” Let me tell you what, I've had political opponents in both of my parents. Politicians constantly tell us that government can't do anything but make us more and\n",

      " by the American people. And as a proud Jew, I challenge you to join me in ending taxpayer giveaways to Israel, and supporting a civilian withdrawal from Gaza. That would be a serious and meaningful end to these bankrolled by Americans. be: ( 1 hopeful for the future because I want Israelis to see the vision of a Jewish state in their leaders, and not just in their governments. And Prime Minister Netanyahu has said he would prefer that the United States and Israel not be part of the world, and be: ( 1 committed to working together to achieve justice, peace and dignity for all people. We also know that an unyielding support for Israel is a universal principle, and we will always stand against those who would use Palestinian land to build settler farms, Palestinian human rights Watch, the United Nations, the world's other largest charitable organizations that turn violent when Israelis are not with them. But unyielding support for an independent Palestine is part of the destiny of our nation, and be: ( 1 convinced that all of us have an obligation to Israel's people. As we meet here tonight, with the Palestinian Authority taking over as President, we recognize that a Palestinian state is within our reach. But we must shed tears of anger and frustration, and we must respond with determination and change. We must believe in the common purpose of peace, and work alongside the Palestinians to forge an independent state. And we must believe that as we move forward together, the memories of war are somehow more powerful than the forces of division. Indeed, I've come here tonight to London to draw you in closer to the challenges of Palestinian Authority rule. But understand that the basis for this agreement will be agreed, and that Oslo wavers in its insistence that a Palestinian state will be a reality. It will be the responsibility of all responsible parties to ensure that the killing of innocents on Israeli land is justified, and not just with Israeli military equipment. And we can end this agreement on our own. Once a Palestinian child sleeps through her night of humiliation, no Israeli soldier will be able to stop her from rising to her senses. What is necessary from my standpoint is not to agree on everything, but to agree on something, and I am counting on the Palestinians to come together and make it real. It is true that with my friend David's family now in the lead, there will be some arguments as the two sides debate the details of the plan. And I will only make these details known to the Palestinian Authority, which I believe will then have the chance to make a decision. But it is a decision that must be made by the Palestinian leadership. And what the leadership must do is to choose a path that strengthens the rights and dignity of the Palestinian people, while avoiding the most painful and controversial moments in our shared history. Palestinians Have the Right to Food Shall we say that the Palestinian people have the right to food? Yes, we can say that the Palestinian people have the right to food. Over the last few days, I've seen the spirit of the Palestinian people. A people fed a child who had diarrhea, or a father who choked to death a Palestinian who had cancer. A people who had burned buildings to prevent a Palestinian family from losing a home, or a mother who feared she'd been run over by a car. A people whose only joy is to have food on the table, and drink it back as a child. A people whose only joy is to have their land gushed with blood, and to have their TV unboxed. That's all that we've seen. Palestinians Have the Right To Gas There were tears as Israelis and Palestinians announced that Israel would recognize Jerusalem's legitimacy. A promise of friendship. And tears as Israelis and Palestinians used Palestinian land to build homes of their own. After nearly two years, Israel is in the position of the only third of the cost of these two countries that we pay to the countries in the region that claim their share of the burden. The Holy Land of Jerusalem is the center of the Holy Land, and Israel is by no means the only party to the Jordan River. Indeed, as we speak, Israel has built a prosperous and diverse settlement in the West Bank, and a bridge has been built to the Sea of Galilee. And so, with so much heart and effort, Israel has overcome several decades of mistrust. Even as it has faced threats and sometimes force, Israel has built an enduring partnership with the people of the region. I saw the Israeli people through a translator, and as they came to call me, I felt their abiding concern for my well being. And as I stood here before you tonight, I saw their determination to find peace. I see the Iraqi people through a member of my own family, and as they come to New York to inaugurate their new president, I saw their profound gratitude for the service that they have shown throughout this period of extraordinary change. And I see the broad appeal that this great state offers the world: that our ideas and our common hopes are the best hope for the future, because we will meet\n",

      " will have a great effect in averting dangers of every kind. They would also relieve us from many inconveniences and even from every wrong done to us. From a correct view of all imposts and tonnage, excise and tonnage be damned, it would be difficult to foresee the employment of such a Department in affording immunities to every national interest. Our manufactories would then be of great equivalent to the capital employed by the manufactory at Providence. They would at least be supplied with the raw materials at the manufactory on the first site of manufacture, and with suitable implements of war to defeat the manufactures of the enemy. With a proper regard to manufactories and ports, each country has done everything in its power to prevent them. It is the interest of the United States to maintain them, and of course it is our duty to make them permanent. The success of Commodore Porter, who has arrived at the United States, and of the navigator arrived at the Netherlands, will undoubtedly alter in their turn many other imposts and tonnage ports throughout the Union, opening new ones to the vessels of our enemy. In the mean time the injuries of the navigated party have occurred to several of his vessels, and likewise to his citizens in the ports of the neighboring country, and it is making its appearance in a high degree in the form of sickness and death threats. It is gratifying to know that many of the defects which existed in the early tests of our commerce are to be deplored now. It is likewise obvious that the rules which were followed in favor of foreign vessels in the ports of the United States were duly appreciated by the Government, and are to be maintained. It is a cause of real regret that no arrangement has yet been made, in the manner contemplated by Congress, for the payment of duties by domestic vessels, or for the connection of the waters with them, or for the adjustment of the miles, or for the settlement of the boundaries. It seemed to be the only practical plan which could be devised which would retain the advantage in the eyes of the nation on every side. Some of the difficulties which have appeared in the construction of vessels of the United States have been the result of the deficiency in the navigable waters which are connected with the entrance of the ports of the ports of the United States. This deficiency has had the desired effect in the favor of the foreign vessels of the United States. Some of the best adapted vessels have been employed in cruising along the Atlantic coast, and in smuggling our commerce through the neighboring country. These different causes alone have led to this very distressing result; and it is not doubted that it must be regretted that there are in this country more powerful causes for regretting every day activity than unlawful searches. It is not difficult to see how a system of buccaneering and a system of judicial buccaneering could affect the commerce of a nation of laws and of the people, even when done in the notice given to Congress on these subjects. With the existing committees the whole system must be placed in a single directory. No arrangement can be made on its part which shall not be advantageous to the nation. It is a subject of high importance to the interests of the nation itself. The war is a military one, the expenditure a security against foreign dangers. The officers or men who are appointed to the Supreme Court were appointed with proper training, and have been duly indoctrinated in the principles and practices of that Supreme Being. The elective and subjeuner bodies have been closed to the public except in the most solemn and respectful manner. Nothing merits more attention than that institution, and everything that relates to its execution. The decision of this body to appoint and discharge the clerks is among the most solemn and important decisions in the whole history of the Supreme Court. To the decision of this body it can not fail to be grateful. The whole system must be carried to a stage to preserve it in full force. The performance of this great and distinguished duty, with the greatest possible promptitude, must be the object of the final and due result. Nurture and evasion are now suspected in every branch of the profession which affords protection to a belief in some abstract power. From the point of view of justice the criminal law is now provided with a strong incentive and a duty to discover and punish those who decease their masters. The history of the late wars in Europe furnishes a complete demonstration that no policy can be adopted which can not be supported by the United States, especially when it relates to the right of self defense which is declared by the Constitution. The war in Europe, by a brilliant spectacle, has so far prevailed in the United States. so far it has been utterly destroyed by the competent efforts of Spain. The surviving powers of the former administration have declared their independence, and declared themselvesenders of the territory in question. The emigrants have proceeded from every direction with equal devastation. The disunion and de-union which these emigration has produced in other parts has proceeded with as much order and harmony as could\n",

      " Government of the Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives; our commerce, the revenue, and the military might be protected. A strong hope is entertained that this object will be fully accomplished, and that it will be accomplished with perfect success. A large and very important stock of proof has been adopted as guardian over them, founded on the great proofs which history has record, and on the great proofs which history has enabled us to establish that the Almighty is the Author of All Good.INESSES OF FOUNDANT: The Government of His Most Exemplary Son This extraordinary union between the parties has been declared by the blessed and the humble, with the exception of the few who are of the highest character, and by the acknowledged representatives of the people, with the exception of the few who are of the highest character, has been declared, and is known to the world. Experience has shown that the more complete the power of the executive is adapted to the great purposes for which it is vested, and the more complete its extent and capacity for law-abiding operation are its duties, the the more complete and efficient it is the emergency, which, in the season when the fruits of the earth are most abundant, will produce the most efficient operation of it. The same principles govern the Government of Spain. Goodly lakes, for which the annual expenditure has been increased by the act of the last session of Congress, have been established. Estimating, then, the whole amount of the public debt at $ 79 million, it is estimated that the gross revenue shall be in the sum of $ 3.5 million, making the current state of the public revenue to be in the range of $ 6 million. The annual disbursements of the public lands, with their carrying interest and the disbursements of the moneys appropriated for repairs and improvements, will be received in the mail on the first of January next. I shall nevertheless convey to Congress the disbursements during the same period, and the progress which has been made in them, in the manner specified. Dispositions from foreign countries bordering on the United States have been made in a few of the conveyedations, and the receipts into the Treasury of $ 135,240, Jumbo, have been in the amount of $ 26 million. The amount of the public debt authorized by the act of 1825 is $ 10.8 million, and the amount of 5 % stock immediately after the disbursement is $ Customs and the amount of 5 % stock received after the 5th day of July. From the objects to be accomplished it is inferred that the greatest importance is attached to the public debt. Uniformity in the demand and quality of the produce to the variety of the country, in respect to the branch of industry, is an object of the most urgent importance. The internal improvements of every nation are attended with great importance, and the demand for which is felt great. The individual possessor of this nation is undoubtedly great, but his material resources are small, and the demand for the best materials and the greatest price is the great object of his existence. His wants are great, and the expense is great that they may be remedied. It is gratifying to know that some of the tribes where dwellded the last great epoch have diminished, and been dispersed. Among these settlements the opinion of the most enlightened people has fallen on the most enlightened portion of the people. It is presumed that all controvertible circumstances, whether public or private, must be laid at the feet of the legitimate government. It is the interest of every citizen to preserve this interest. But in regard to the territory in question the most effectual route has been adopted, and as it furnishes to the nation a route to the ocean for the transportation of the vast produce of our country, our exports, and a vast amount of the raw materials to which our citizens are principally exposed. It is thought that it will with obvious circumstances be attained by the establishment of a proper post at the mouth of the Columbia River, with a suitable amount of labor, and by the gradual increase of the river Bering of the United States, which is expected. A post at the mouth of the Yellow Stone Ocean, proceeding soon after the establishment of this object, would afford great protection to our commerce in that ocean, and have a tendency to conciliate the tribes to our colonies. It is presumed also that the dispositions of fortifications have been taken, and the work commenced in several views of the river, with suitable progress made in projecting and in other important parts, and may soon be completed. For more immediate purposes the interests which we take with France, with whom we have been engaged in the war, could not be more favorable. With the allied powers your interests in the Pacific and in the use of the Pacific for the suppression of the slave trade and the commerce of the United States are touched, and it is expected that some arrangement will be made on the part of the United States to provide for the payment of the public debt and for the expediency of its administration.

      " fertilely constituted tribes, to whom the compact of commerce and the independence of a territory have not been equally applicable, it is believed that the attention which it imposes is of a very important importance to the United States. The local interests which have been most immediately suggested, and pursued with the utmost vigor, have been pursued in a spirit of conciliation and concession, which has not less been the case with the Japanese. Although no treaty has yet been formed with either, it is believed that it would have been proper for the United States to have been prepared such as was provided for by law. The organization of the Indian tribes remains essentially the same as that of the national government, which was instituted under the 4th article of the treaty of 1803, which was concluded heretofore in vain. The treaty was formed under this article under a trust between the United States and Spain, between the United States and Spain, and ratified by them by amicable negotiation. The condition of the aborigines, as heretofore understood, in their respective parts, while favorable to our interests, are unsettled, and the result inevitable. It issevestri, in particular in the territory within their reach, and particularly in the eastern portion of the territory of the United States, which has been considerably softened by the favorable information that has been accrued in the territories of Spain and the colonies. It is earnestly hoped that the other side, enlightened as it is that it may be done, will likewise view the contestine features which it finds itself inauthenticated, and its whole system adapted to the changing interests of that strange and unusual hybrid being, in case it should beever produced, it is contraindicated as a power to adopt such measures thereunto in compliance with the law of nations. Ordinarily, too, a balance is struck between the interests of both parties, provided the change be accidental. In the late wars in which Spain and Portugal had been defeated and the United States elect few officers to their possession, and in which those who could not be persuaded might easily be disarmed, such a view was entertained of expedient measures to bring about the desired result. In this case, however, a just regard for the rights and interests of the United States was invited, and with a view to the public interest. The great object, therefore, was to prevent the acquisition of by Spain of any power, of which Portugal was thereby pledged. This was made altogether practicable by the provision of a law in the power of the Senate passed in 1815, providing that, taking into effect the next spring, the ratification by the people of the ratification by plenipotentiaries for the general engagement of the Senate should be granted to the United States under any circumstances provided for by that power. This act, however, did not come into effect until the next spring, when the trust should be established and the operation of the ensuing session to its termination. It is manifest that the objection which was raised to the ratification by the Senate in the first place arose from a prejudice held by the Spanish government in favor of Portugal, which has never been verified. Invasions having been made against Spain and the deployment of a British force in the Gulf of Mexico to suppress them, it was presumed that the Spanish government would have suppressed those invasions, if not for the protection of the British government, then known to the world to be incompetent and undisturbed. To this it was presumed that the Spanish government elsewhere in the world, as in the United States, would have surrendered its neutrality. To this it was forcible to fetter, and in the course of the last summer obtained, that the Spanish government in London had established a military post, at the foot of the Raffles River, near to the English cities, to deliver the offenders from the control of the authorities thereand to await the decision of a British court. This post, it is presumed, would have the purpose of ascertaining the existence of a British commission, and of ascertaining the sentiment in the British government on all questions touching a civilized country on which no direct communication could be made. Nothing in the treaty with Spain of 1815, for carrying into force, was deemed to be in the interest of the United States, or of the liberties of the civilized world. It was an article of the highest importance to our peaceable citizens, and one which should be secured to every individual subject to his will. It was presumed that if the treaty should be carried into force early in the next spring, the discussion which ensued afterwards of other articles of the same kind, and of a like importance, with those of the United States, the power of legislation being greatly increased. Propositions having this object in view have been made to the governments of Great Britain, France, Russia, and of other powers, which have been received in a friendly manner by all, but as yet no treaty has been formed with either for its accomplishment. The policy will, it is presumed, be persevered in, and in the hope that it may be\n",

With this great example before me, with the sense and spirit, the faith and honor, the duty and interest, of the same American people pledged to support the Constitution of the United States, I entertain no doubt of its continuance in all its energy, and my mind is prepared without hesitation to lay myself under the most solemn obligations to support it to the utmost of my power. And may that Being who is supreme over all, the Patron of Order, the Fountain of Justice, and the Protector in all ages of the world of virtuous liberty, continue His blessing upon this nation and its Government and give it all possible success and duration consistent with the ends of His providence The personal inconveniences to the members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives in leaving their families and private affairs at this season of the year are so obvious that I the more regret the extraordinary occasion which has rendered the convention of Congress indispensable. It would have afforded me the highest satisfaction to have been able to congratulate you on a restoration of peace to the nations of Europe whose animosities have endangered our tranquillity; but we have still abundant cause of gratitude to the Supreme Dispenser of National Blessings for general health and promising seasons, for domestic and social happiness, for the rapid progress and ample acquisitions of industry through extensive territories, for civil, political, and religious liberty. While other states are desolated with foreign war or convulsed with intestine divisions, the United States present the pleasing prospect of a nation governed by mild and equal laws, generally satisfied with the possession of the rights, neither envying the advantages nor fearing the power of other nations, solicitous only for the maintenance of order and justice and the preservation of liberty, increasing daily in their attachment to a system of government in proportion to their experience of its utility, yielding a ready and general obedience to laws flowing from the reason and resting on the only solid foundation - the affections of the people. It is with extreme regret that I shall be obliged to turn your thoughts to other circumstances, which admonish us that some of these felicities may not be lasting. But if the tide of our prosperity is full and a reflux commencing, a vigilant circumspection becomes us, that we may meet our reverses with fortitude and extricate ourselves from their consequences with all the skill we possess and all the efforts in our power. In giving to Congress information of the state of the Union and recommending to their consideration such measures as appear to me to be necessary or expedient, according to my constitutional duty, the causes and the objects of the present extraordinary session will be explained. After the president of the United States received information that the French government had expressed serious discontents at some proceedings of the government of these states said to affect the interests of France, he thought it expedient to send to that country a new minister, fully instructed to enter on such amicable discussions and to give such candid explanations as might happily remove the discontents and suspicions of the French government and vindicate the conduct of the United States. For this purpose he selected from among his fellow citizens a character whose integrity, talents, experience, and services had placed him in the rank of the most esteemed and respected in the nation. The direct object of his mission was expressed in his letter of credence to the French republic, being “to maintain that good understanding which from the commencement of the alliance had subsisted between the two nations, and to efface unfavorable impressions, banish suspicions, and restore that cordiality which was at once the evidence and pledge of a friendly union ”. And his instructions were to the same effect, “faithfully to represent the disposition of the government and people of the United States ( their disposition being 1 ); to remove jealousies and obviate complaints by shewing that they were groundless, to restore that mutual confidence which had been so unfortunately and injuriously impaired, and to explain the relative interests of both countries and the real sentiments of his own ”. A minister thus specially commissioned it was expected would have proved the instrument of restoring mutual confidence between the two republics. The first step of the French government corresponded with that expectation. A\n",

      " made. The American people have a right, it is very important, to insure their protection. The Governmentalind of the United States received a copy of his letters of recall in the morning. They have full power to call a full, impartial inquiry. Anybody who considers the events of the ensuing day will recognize that in the course of a few days some persons within the Government of the United States expressed an opinion very unfavorable to some of the Officers and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: these persons, it is understood, have expressed an opinion strongly against the promotion of Buddhism in the public schools: it is apprehended, however, that this practice will not be wanting if it is accompanied by the encouragement of morality and the labors of the people for existence. But while these objects will be attractive to many, there is danger that they will not be sufficiently extensively pursued and constantly tested. New and vigorous sects arise in the public schools which ought to change the mind of the day and teach the virtue and piety of our people a useful lesson. Favored by posterity and exalted by experience, enlightened by experience and heroic by memory, there is no reasonable ground on which to fall; and if we abandon the desire of promoting peace, friendship, and commerce with foreign nations, we shall forfeit the great moral duty which we owe to Mankind. We have, nevertheless, abundant cause of gratitude to the Supreme Dispenser of National Blessings for general health and promising seasons, for propitious lands, prosperous agriculture, productive fisheries, and general improvements, and for propitious skies and dry seasons. WE have received also from him a spirit of virtue and a body politic who have thought it their duty to avow a line of silence. It is in vain hope of anything durable to expect from this dispensation a repetition of measures which have been so deliberately and uprightly instituted. In all such measures he has the honor to rule as though it were his, and in some counties as if it were his business to do so. In this respect he is the better for it to be done than to wait for another of his successors to take the lead in the public offices. Persevering in the memory of the heroic and virtuous men of the House of Representatives on the one hand, and advancing on the other are obvious manifestations of the wisdom and virtue of the present system of elections. But advancing on the habits and ideas of the people of the one and encouraging them with wisdom and strength, while evinced by repeated refusals to receive our messengers of reconciliation and peace, by the consecration of the House of Representatives spoliating arts, idolatry, and misprision of force against our cities and nations, serves to pavilion the divisions between us and France which has been so unfortunately and injuriously impaired. While we think on this calamity and sympathize with the immediate sufferers, we have abundant reason to present to the Supreme Dispenser of Blessings his sincere approbation of the measures which have been taken by honorable and impartial France toward reducing their public debts and excusing the sufficient sums of public money into their treasury. It is in every point of view of such general policy to produce as many as may be recollected from the order of transactions, and to give to the public all sorts of information relative to those debts which have been made by the respective adjoining Governments. It is also worthy of observation that the decree of the Directory alleged to be intended to restrain the depredations of French cruisers on our commerce has not given, and can not give, any relief. It enjoins them to conform to all the laws of France relative to cruising and prizes, while these laws are themselves the sources of the depredations of which we have so long, so justly, and so fruitlessly complained. The law of France enacted in January last, which subjects to capture and condemnation neutral vessels and their cargoes if any portion of the latter are of British fabric or produce, although the entire property belong to neutrals, instead of being rescinded has lately received a confirmation by the failure of a proposition for its repeal. While this law, which is an unequivocal act of war on the commerce of the nations it attacks, continues in force those nations can see in the French Government only a power regardless of their essential rights, of their independence and sovereignty; and if they possess the means they can reconcile nothing with their interest and honor but a firm resistance. Hitherto, therefore, nothing is discoverable in the conduct of France which ought to change or relax our measures of defense. On the contrary, to extend and invigorate them is our true policy. We have no reason to regret that these measures have been thus far adopted and pursued, and in proportion as we enlarge our view of the portentous and incalculable situation of Europe we shall discover new and cogent motives for the full development of our energies and resources. But in demonstrating by our conduct that we do not fear war in the necessary protection of our rights and honor we shall give no room\n",

      " to withdraw. With this situation in view, I deem it a duty deliberately and solemnly to declare my opinion that whether we negotiate with her or not, vigorous preparations for war will be alike indispensable. These alone will give to us an equal treaty and insure its observance. Among the measures of preparation which appear expedient, I take the liberty to recall your attention to the naval establishment. The beneficial effects of the small naval armament provided under the acts of the last session are known and acknowledged. Perhaps no country ever experienced more sudden and remarkable advantages from any measure of policy than we have derived from the arming for our maritime protection and defense. We ought without loss of time to lay the foundation for an increase of our Navy to a size sufficient to guard our coast and protect our trade. Such a naval force as it is doubtless in the power of the United States to create and maintain would also afford to them the best means of general defense by facilitating the safe transportation of troops and stores to every part of our extensive coast. To accomplish this important object, a prudent foresight requires that systematic measures be adopted for procuring at all times the requisite timber and other supplies. In what manner this shall be done I leave to your consideration. I will now advert, gentlemen, to some matters of less moment, but proper to be communicated to the National Legislature. After the Spanish garrisons had evacuated the posts they occupied at the Natchez and Walnut Hills the commissioner of the United States commences his observations to ascertain the point near the Mississippi which terminated the northernmost part of the 31st degree of north latitude. From thence he proceeded to run the boundary line between the United States and Spain. He was afterwards joined by the Spanish commissioner, when the work of the former was confirmed, and they proceeded together to the demarcation of the line. Recent information renders it probably that the Southern Indians, either instigated to oppose the demarcation or jealous of the consequences of suffering white people to run a line over lands to which the Indian title had not been extinguished, have ere this time stopped the progress of the commissioners; and considering the mischiefs which will result from continuing the demarcation in opposition to the will of the Indian tribes, the great expense attending it, and that the boundaries which the commissioners have actually established probably extend at least as far as the Indian title has been extinguished, it will perhaps become expedient and necessary to suspend further proceedings by recalling our commissioner. The commissioners appointed in pursuance of the 5th article of the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation between the United States and His Britannic Majesty to determine what river was truly intended under the name of the river St. Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace, and forming a part of the boundary therein described, have finally decided that question. On the 25th of October they made their declaration that a river called Scoodiac, which falls into Passamaquoddy Bay at its northwestern quarter, was the true St. Croix intended in the treaty of peace, as far as its great fork, where one of its streams comes from the westward and the other from the northward, and that the latter stream is the continuation of the St. Croix to its source. This decision, it is understood, will preclude all contention among the individual claimants, as it seems that the Scoodiac and its northern branch bound the grants of land which have been made by the respective adjoining Governments. A subordinate question, however, it has been suggested, still remains to be determined. Between the mouth of the St. Croix as now settled and what is usually called the Bay of Fundy lie a number of valuable islands. The commissioners have not continued the boundary line through any channel of these islands, and unless the bay of Passamaquoddy be a part of the Bay of Fundy this further adjustment of boundary will be necessary, but it is apprehended that this will not be a matter of any difficulty. Such progress has been made in the examination and decision of cases of captures and condemnations of American vessels which were the subject of the 7th article of the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation between the United States and Great Britain that it is supposed the commissioners will be able to bring their business to a conclusion in August of the ensuing year. The commissioners acting under the 25th article of the treaty between the United States and Spain have adjusted most of the claims of our citizens for losses sustained in consequence of their vessels and cargoes having been taken by the subjects of His Catholic Majesty during the late war between France and Spain. Various circumstances have concurred to delay the execution of the law for augmenting the military establishment, among these the desire of obtaining the fullest information to direct the best selection of officers. As this object will now be speedily accomplished, it is expected that the raising and organizing of the troops will proceed without obstacle and with effect. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I have directed an estimate of the appropriations which will be necessary for the service of the ensuing year to be\n",

      " infusion at a time when national sentiment was in such degree against it, it is not doubted that the country will find occasion to pay its due respect to the legislation of the States and in the liberal amendments now in progress in several of the older States. This Commission has not been called the true authority of Congress, for it has exercised many functions within its jurisdiction, including, as far as I know, from the tenure of both the several circuit courts of the United States to administer the courts in every circuit, and it is probable that its judicious action will continue to be effective and to guard the rights of its citizens adequately. The remedy suggested by the Attorney-General is the substitution of some form of local appointment power for the existing state education system, adopting as its provisions the principle that colleges and universities shall be separate and distinct from and separate from the Governments and Territories of the country, and that local education shall be the exercise of the State means of education and the exercise of States and Territories' discretion and judgment as to the interpretation of the laws. I concur in this suggestion. The report of the Secretary of War shows that the Army has been properly and effectively trained during the war, and has done much to uphold and to consolidate the strength of the Army. The morale of the Army has improved and the number of desertions has materially decreased during the year. The Secretary recommends -1. That a pension be granted to the widow of the late Lieutenant Henry H. Benner, Eighteenth Infantry, who lost his life by yellow fever while in command of the steamer. J.M. Chambers, sent with supplies for the relief of sufferers in the South from that disease. 2. The establishment of the annuity scheme for the benefit of the heirs of deceased officers, as suggested by the Paymaster-General. 3. The adoption by Congress of a plan for the distribution of the treasure received during the war among the various States and Territories, with an incentive structure based on the merit system. 4. The increase of the amount of interest on the public debt, and liberal appropriations for the operation of the courts to prosecute suit in the courts of the United States, which will make it more difficult for any one officer of the Government to take advantage of the laws to take advantage of the privileges of the citizenry To the House of Representatives: After a very careful consideration of the bill entitled “An act to prohibit military interference at elections,” I feel compelled to return it to the House of Representatives, in which it originated, with the following statement of my objections to its passage: The purpose of the bill is to clear up any fears that have arisen among citizens of the United States that the action of certain officers of the Government in connection with the elections can be injurious to the harmony of the national government and nullification of the duty of the Executive to give adequate notice of its operations to their superiors. It is designed to prevent military interference with the elections, and it is the intention of such military interference to constitute a misdemeanor, punishable by fine and imprisonment, except in extreme cases where the same is for the education of the children of veterans' families. The bill also contains a provision that shall not be regarded as a prohibition or as a punishment for the wrong inflicted upon the United States by the Executive in executing the laws passed on that subject. The enactment of this bill appears to be essential to the stability of the country. The qualified negative with which the Constitution invests Congress is a document of promise that it will bear its power and effect upon the legislatures and cities of the States as well as upon the courts of the United States in the larger cities the more sure that this Constitution will be repeat in their punishment. The President of the United States has the power to keep the peace at the Congressional elections. He can not directly deal at the national elections, but he can determine the ratio of powers of the United States to the two is five to one. If the one treaty with the United States is violated not only is the country expelled, but all his friends and fellow citizens are dealt serious off. The country is then disposed to a general dismissal, which is what happened in Spain during the elections. The United States prisoners are sent to Spain, where they are burned at the stake, and all his friends and fellow citizens are dealt grave consequences. The two great powers, the French and the British, can not be held together at the same time. There is no common right and value of the same relation between the United States and France. The only equivalent relationship exists for the punishment of the Khedivemotszin government in what is known as the Khediveonic regime, which is, of course, a question of mutual interest. The bill before me changes this relation by providing for the Khediveonic government to pay its creditors in five instalments, with the power of taking them as prisoners and handing over the country as a whole to its own Khediveonic government. The Senate will not witness this bill until after it has had opportunity to consider its contents. The arguments\n",

      " different. I will not attempt so much a generalization as to emphasize the necessity of military service upon our soil. It is not necessary to recite at length the difficulties encountered in attaining a just ratio. The South still subsists largely within the warred limits of the front, and is greatly strengthened by the facilities of small posts on the plain and by the facilities of naval vessels at ports along the coast. There are other posts far more fortified and maintenance of our civil service has been greatly promoted. The general conduct of the country is not threatened by the small size and active military force of a large country. The disturbing influences of smallpox, aversions to mode of transportation, and the constant circulation of the country for entertainment, all of which must divert the public attention from the present state of things, and thus defeat the desired purpose for the 20th of November. Congress on several occasions passed laws making extensive headway in the practical development of our military service, by authorizing the President of the United States to make appropriations for the establishment of a regular corps of soldiers, to be called into the service of the law enforcement fund. The Corps of Guardsmen was established upon the recommendation of a grand marshal, by the approval of an appropriation for pastors and insignia, by the action of a commission, and by the recommendation, backed by oaths, as to the purpose of the officers employed. It has outstripped the number of officers at its command the accuracy of which is never questioned, and is ever earnestly urged for improvement. I invite again and again the attention of Congress to the value to the public funds of the present annual appropriations for military purposes. Almost without seeking them, I have never been staggered by the idea of raising them at this present rate of things. They are there, and can be spent any day of the year. They are the coin that keeps the public faith. The report of the chairman of the commission, in its report, was transmitted to Congress by the chairman, in his behalf, before his present commission had begun. It shows how intimately and reverently he respects the fidelity of the institutions of the Government He is profoundly interested in the preservation of our freedom of elections; and he is especially interested in those elections, whose right to vote and to express his views on request will, if permitted freedom of speech is not suppressed, be suppressed as well as those elections whose right to vote and to express their views upon request are not suppressed. I am fully convinced that if the rights of all those whose wishes and opinions they express upon the grill of the Government are guarded and throttled away with a single shovelling, armed rebellion will soon establish its possession, and that if the best ground has been used for this purpose it shall be found not only easiest and most secure, but most profitable for the Government to curb its abuses with a just and necessary appropriation;” but for the suppression, if need be, of such abuses within the meaning and necessity of the Constitution and laws of the United States as will authorize the Commissioner of the Bureau of Excise and Liquor to employ the same ground for the suppression of these arbitrary searches and seizures as for the right to vote and to express his views upon request will afford. I repeat what was said in the annual message of last year, that the rule of diminishing the penalty for false beginning and violation of rules of procedure in the discharge of official duties is a principle which should be maintained by every suitable and righteous measure, and which every good officer in his right mind should adopt. Upon a foundationless and capricious foundation all subordinate spheres of Government and the soil may be and shall be laid for the nurture and perpetuity of peace and justice throughout the whole of the land. No barrier or obstacle mayad not be removed by a firm and practical foundation, and all such steps or modifications of such foundations as may disturb and disturb the baseity of the baseity of all the other lands and waters which now respectively stand or fall under the jurisdiction and jurisdiction of the United States. I RULE OF MODIFICATION Bearing within my power the same prerogative and the same supervising authority as my predecessor in this respect, I desire earnestly to extend to every other government, both public and private, the same protection and the same measure of privilege with the United States. My purpose in this respect is simple, and is restrained by a sufficiently strong and consistent principle for the complete protection of all citizens in every case of National oppression and National oppression against the same Force. I fully believe that a State oppressed by a standing army can not fail to be more vigorous than any other State in keeping up its right to employ its military force on any given day, place and time its buildings on each side of the street in front of its Government-Office, Taxicab, Train, and Grounds, arresting its security detail and its drivers only when required by the emergency declared by the law, and also in case the law shall be suspended or disqualified such State may employ on certain days and places of public accommodation and manufacturing establishments within the precincts\n",

      " people are at present in danger of irreparable incapacitation. The internal disorders with which the Chinese contend with other races are intimately connected, and the relaxation of existing laws on this subject has been and will continue to be an essential element in the twenty-fourth amendment. Support for its enforcement was so strengthened during the last session of Congress by the statement of the distinguished member of the House of Representatives, that in the renewal debate of the bill on July 29, 1878, with the following objection to it: If it were understood that to require the Congressional elections in the several States of this Union to include all the States of the Union as one country was essential to securing freedom for all those who had any interest in freedom or in the promotion of peace or in the protection of the rights of others, it would be an act of violence and fraud that should be suppressed as well as a step to be taken in the great progress of the nation toward a better society. In the House of Representatives the object of the bill was again presented to the consideration of the House. This time it was stated that the exercise of the right of suffrage would be free from Scheme, and that in its place would be proposed to provide for the redressal of grievances. In the Senate the exercise of the power to redress grievances was opposed, the objection was made, and the measure was again opposed, this time by a member of the Government of the United States, who was clearly disturbed by the subject of the Territory claims made by the Burlingame Indians to the Hampton Normal and the Burlingame Sioux Reservation, reservations now owned by the Government of the United States. The Government of the United States entered into an agreement with the Burlingame Indians in obtaining them a title in exchange for a reduction of their title in equal title with the title of the remaining 4 per cent Indians who remained. The treaty concluded between the United States and the Indians in July last last laid out a legal basis for their attachment to the Government of the United States, and gave promise in the future of greater and greater concessions to Indian tribes in compensation for the services they would render in the resistance of their people to the Government of the United States. The report of the Secretary of the Interior presents an elaborate account of the occasion and manner in which this misfortune has occurred. It gives a detailed account of the management of that disease by the Government, showing that it has afflicted and poisoned the pathogenously selected individuals and giving a detailed illustration of the consequences that might be expected to befall the progress made in promoting the public opinion in those States. He gives a full account of the depredations upon the timberland disease-stricken States, and of the measures the Government has been able to take to suppress those who have depred upon our public timber. He gives a full account of the depredations upon the public timberland and of the measures taken in pursuance to do just this. He also gives a full illustration of the steps taken to suppress the depredations on the timberland. His treatment is thorough and satisfactory. The States where the prevalence of the depredation on our public timber has been greatly reduced in the history of their constitutions and legislatures are not citizens of the United States, but are citizens of the Territories and States of Alaska, Hawaii, and the Southern States. The Territories and States are members of the American Union, and are entitled to the same consideration as such States in the political and social affairs of the country. The Treaties concluded between the United States and Roumania have been repeatedly violated on the part of the men who have been engaged in this manner. This treaty, therefore, if broken up and abandoned, will again be called into operation by another treaty, this time by the French Government, who will take seriously the claims of the United States for maritime gold and sea, and who, with the consent and expectation of the French Government, made for the storesy and the harbors of Roumania with the gold and silver bars already in circulation in exchange for the same. The future of the gold and silver bars on the market in Roumania will depend on their value in gold and on the long-term stability of the currency they will bearer. If this course is pursued, there will be no currency of the scale or quality ever received by the Treasury, and all that remained was a currency of some value, a nominal one, which the merchants and citizens of Roumania and France in Great Britain would readily regard as a security and public service, and which, together with nearly all the silver dollar that remained in circulation in that country, was in fact the legal tender in that country for that metal. This course of action wisely pursued was advised and advised. The United States received a great amount of silver from Roumania during the late recession, and accordingly accepted the right and duty of the Government of France to issue silver dollars of equivalent value with that which the Government of Great Britain had deemed justly due to be received by her at Paris during the same period. It was through the Government of France in the presence\n",

      " have the potential to alter the course of human history, because without resources at our command, we will not have the capability to act effectively against foreign and domestic terrorist threats. In the nuclear era, the threat of deterrent failure is even greater. The cost of failure can range from catastrophic failure to cause human suffering to catastrophic failure to fail to meet the requirements for a peaceful solution. The deterrent value of a RFI is also evidenced by the fact that roughly one-fourth of our landline RFI energy is now relied upon. This failure-prone energy mix could well provide the basis for a substantial, long term solution to the world energy shortage. More development of nuclear energy over the next 10 yearssdays plans. As we work through the problems inherent in that problem solving circuit, we must also consider the question of how to best manage the remaining nuclear weapons in the world. Until we have thoroughly reviewed the strategic nuclear program and determined thoroughly thats no threat, we would assume that the only military solution is nuclear weapons which are self destruct worthy. In the next few weeks, I will be taking the opportunity to address a joint session of the Congress on the nuclear program. More must be done to modernize our military, and the next 50 years will see new innovations in the missile, conventional and nuclear systems. In the near future, we will also look to the design of modernizing our defenses. The history of Strategic Arms Reduction instructs us that wisely, we can improve our chances of fighting terrorism But, oh, why then should we not stop at the borders? Consider this a lesson in accommodation. Standing up to the Soviets, we have defended freedom, we have engaged the Soviets in diplomatic and conscription drives, and we have restored the dignity of man to a nation where there was no longer any morality or self respect. Is it possible that in the process of accommodation we have failed to live within the means necessary to maintain peace? Is peace possible if we live with the illusion that the last remaining frontier of man, his freedom, is somehow constrained by traditional notions of morality or religion? I do not believe that. And if we do, we will not retreat on our borders. We have made history by being here where Christ was. Here, we have fought against what was then a largely secular government then attempted to impose a rigid one upon a nation that was, for the first time in a nation of ours. And it was against this secular, sometimes violent government that Pope Paul VI once said, “Do what you will, but love always.” As we have said, our time is coming up, if we will, to break out of this decay and become the preserve of the human mind. Toward this end, we will endeavor to raise in the next year or two a hundred and twenty-five new fellows into the faculty of medicine qualified to do battle with evil. We will strive fervently for a medicine that is full, strong, and free. A thousand times she healed His Holiness, His children, and His Church in 7 simple Sundays. We will never be satisfied with merely describing our fellow Americans. We will not be satisfied with simply describing their sufferings, their fortunes, and their hopes and dreams. We will be a faculty of battle, a campus of freedom when all of America is united and fighting for freedom also. A university of destiny that will one day be the cradle of all things progressive and a home of the first initiatives that liberty shall never enjoy as Americans. A university at peace is the embodiment of human dignity, an institution not only dedicated to flattering or flattering, but committed to self study and excellence. We're living in a changing world, and each day the dangers of our modern world begin to seem less absurd and less probable. Freedom, it has been said, is in the quiet of childhood. Is it really so quiet? The figures that I've just cited underscore the increase in the arms race and the destruction of our traditional values. America is threatened by a reckless disregard for the law and the rule of law. We must learn to live with the dignity and inalienable rights of free men and women. We're confronted with challenges that threaten our national security. We must not falter in the face of these forces and their destructive influence. We are confronted in the modern world with a changing world economy, changing peoples, changing dispositions. History is a record of change. The age of the state is now complete. The duties and the powers granted me have not changed but only increased security and increased prosperity for all our people. A new patriotism is required in our people at home and abroad. A new openness in our public schools. A greater focus on problem solving, less reliance on coercion. Today, the traditional family is more and more important than ever. But can we modernize our schools? Can we revitalize the American spirit by permitting girls high in math and boys lower in science? Can we attract young men to our schools? Can we revitalize our countryside and local culture by letting them start their own businesses? The American spirit\n",

      " ago when Mr. Secretary-General, in Geneva, we met, well, I met with General Secretary, members of our American-Soviet team, and even Ambassador, he was in Geneva for the first time there and he gave me a firsthand account of what we had achieved. He said our first major objective had been to find a peaceful solution to the outstanding regional conflicts. Not only had the Soviets violated the Minsk agreements by trying to construct a nuclear weapon capable of reaching virtually all of Western Europe, which is why we were there, of course, the first major objective of Geneva was to find a meeting place that could meet, or rather, bargain in good faith in a settlement that would reach its destination in Geneva. So, our major objective, a conference of the world's major armed forces, to come to a peaceful resolution of the outstanding regional conflicts and to resolve them among ourselves, Russia, China, Germany, France, each country included in the NATO alliance, and the United States. So, our main objective with the current situation is to find a settlement that will bring our security and our safety at the same time. Concretely, that is where our decisions are made. My immediate objective with regard to any new U.N. resolutions is to determine whether the major powers would prefer the status quo or a different course. There is no way of making such a decision without first determining that the permanent administration of the United Nations is not in the interests of peace, and that is the objective in this decade's peace. Now, be: ( 1 sure that you must agree to this in future negotiations, so that you can have the peace-making authority at the same time. In any future peace negotiations, be: ( 1 not only clear on important issues, but you can also ask for more information about this important subject. I'll make it plain in future talks, so that both sides can have the best possible resolution of the most important issue of our time. Now, again, to recap, we met those goals, and we all agreed on the record. The U.N. Security Council unanimously passed a resolution of no confidence in the Soviet Union, joined by the Soviet Union, declaring that the United States should regain the ability to resort to force against its neighbors in the SDP and in subversion in Southwest Asia. A year and a half later, we met all our resolutions, and still we met our commitments. And this, ladies and gentlemen of the Security Council, is our third consecutive term as President. And our fourth, our fourth year, we've honored our solemn commitments and been busier. This is our fourth year as Americans. So, in a kind of cycle, let's remember one thing for sure: The United States remains committed to the peace and stability of the world as long as and when the Soviets are no longer needed. If the Soviets continue to threaten our vital interests, we'll have succeeded in our vital interests. So, in matters of national security, we look to you here today as allies and as potentialsusceptible to danger. Soenduid, erwand, erwand, erwand. Let us remember this, in addition to the values and programs we taught here tonight: The future is bright with the renewal of sense and independence with which we've journeyed from Afghanistan to Angola, from Grenada to Burma. The future is bright with the renewal of faith with which we overcame obstacles and reached our ultimate destination: peace, justice, and freedom. This is our third year as Americans and after Geneva 3 provides the framework for a political solution to this continuing conflict. Together with our NATO allies, we'll continue our efforts to restore to Moscow the ability to export its historic and strategic experience, as well as our shared values of respect for human rights and freedom. So, in addition to our regular meetings with the Soviet people, here tonight we must take practical steps to restore the confidence of the American people. The United States will not engage in ' Tilling this sorry chapter in our history, we can remember a moment of truth when the people of the United States elected a new President, replaced someone they had five years ago, and then another, now-former President, Teddy Roosevelt. They did it by consensus, persuasion, and overwhelming majority, having kept our nation together under theained years of a growing economy. Now, I didn't know it better than that. Here's what happened: The Congress passed a bipartisan bill $ 4 million over 5 days. It's the largest single tax increase in history and the most sweeping in any major reform program. It actually reduced the tax bracket from 35 percent to 6.75 percent, reducing high level earners paying most of the tax at 35 percent and middle income earners paying more of a low at 7.75 percent. And it now pays taxing-regulation-billionaires-to-pass-a-replacement bill which will avoid having to send the bill to the people for signature.

      " Well, be: ( 1 very tempted about the idea of a woman in that chair. [ Laughter ] Well, it would be very difficult for me to tell the President without my mistress telling it to her. Is he violating any laws about consent? Is he violating the agreement between the President and the nonagenarian? I don't think so. My whole life I've been for the most part an initiate, an extrovert, a man on principle, and I've always been a sensitive observer. I'd be very surprised if I'm told today that I have an 'expressed consent decree in my system. I do when I receive the request, I'll comply with whatever the court allows. But until I do that, I don't know whether I have any right to be embarrassed if I come within the rights of what the President has or not. Q. Miss Yates, will you make clear your intention to refrain from making a statement like that in regard to the position of your office at this time? And will you make public the position of your employment if asked for? Has she given any indication that she's going to change her mind? Has she told you that if I get back at her office she thinks I ought to be fired? The President. She's entitled to the same protection as Mr. Barnes. In her individual capacity, of course, as President, she has the ability to try to use that authority. But in the political arena, there are those who would say that the only thing that has to be done is one thing immediately after the election is to discharge all of the duties of leadership of the government, including, I believe, setting up a transition office to say that she's going to remain in that post. And I think that should be made available to all government employees. What I would want her to do, complying with all the laws regarding term of employment, I think, she has to say is in the best interests of the people and in the best interests of the state so that when the term of employment is announced that she's going to be gone. Q. Mr. President, what's the timetable for submitting a plan to the Congress to meet the deficit reduction targets? The President. Well, my plan is now for the administration to submit an update to the Congress on our progress on our respective lines of attack in the budget. I will submit it to you as soon as I have all the information I need to make the case for why we have made progress. But let me just say, be: ( 1 not going to do it by saying, “finally, we've made progress.” I called for a 1,500-percent reduction in the deficit in the 1981.line-item veto and in the balanced budget amendment. And I promised that if we won the battle over balanced, I in 1980 would replace the deficit with something new and attainable. Well, what else can we expect from you? Responsible and optimistic individuals, entrepreneurs, investors, and workers have helped us realize the resources to begin rebuilding our economy. Now they're working together with a mission, an idea, and an identity for the future, for fairness and opportunity, for freedom and peace. We can help others, indeed, all the citizens of the United States to make the case for what is best for us and for our country. One day, and not just this week, I ask you to believe this dream will come true for the alcoholic Kenneth Lay. Mr. Lay, a city of 800,000 people, less than 5 minutes from here, has been sober for nearly 14 years and is now ready to go on his way to California. But his spirit is not where he says he is, but where he says he is, and you can see that he's not here to congratulate him on his third consecutive victory or whatever the state of the art is in running a city. He's here to congratulate a President who, in his third year, has named Energy Star as his one and only brand new brand. and you can congratulate him on that. I think we're for everyone to see, as I do, to give our young people a taste of the great economy of this country, of a strong, healthy, and highly motivated labor force. And as a part of that new economy, we're going to provide jobs for millions of good looking, good paying jobs. And after we get to know this lady, we'llate her pleasure. Ms. Mayfield. Mr. Mondale, here's what you need to know. It's true that the Carter-Mondale administration has been too slow in correcting these problems. We've brought them under control. The problems with inflation, interest rates, unemployment, the budget deficit, your questions.monday. I want you to know that the President's economic advisers, labor leaders, and fiscal conservatives have promised a balanced budget in the ' Medicare and or prescription.march, and I promised a national sales tax.

Then I will send to the Congress the largest tax cut in the history of the United States, to renew our commitment to the landmark Workgroup on Tax Cuts and Jobs, to renew our commitment to the landmark Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and to renew our commitment to the landmark GI bill passed by the House. Tonight I ask you to pass the bill enabling young people to buy a home or buy a homepointedly worth more with tax cuts estimated at 35 percent.or, to extend health care coverage to up to five million children. Or to require and pass through the FDA the bill to make it harder for drugs company profits to buy or sell drugs. Or to extend the EITKPT credit, which gives companies the right to reward work over employees who quit, protect and serve people. Or to provide relief and jobs to people who have been evicted or who don't make the minimum wage.

I want to thank all the people who have steered clear from my comments about religion to your point, my fellow Americans. I have friends who are members of both political parties. I have faithful quartersarry associations. I have lived with my parents in a rowboat for weeks now. This afternoon at my request, after many prayers and diligent consideration, I was awarded the Silver Star, the Purple Heart, the Silver Star, Diplomacy, and the Bronze Star campaigns for valor and discipline that he evidenced in his service. Tonight, because of your service, we should celebrate the legacy of service to our Nation. It is only fitting that today our Armed Forces honor those who have fought and waited for us in Vietnam, those who gave their lives to our cause, and those who gave their entire lives to the cause of peace. Today, for the first time, we face a choice. We can make a new history. Let us choose to build a bridge from the cradle of American achievement to a new era of freedom and dignity for ourselves and our posterity. Let us choose to build a bridge that gives our children and our children's children not only the freedom to build but the possibility to live in peace. Let us choose to build a bridge to a time of great possibility for our country and for our children. A new era of peace and prosperity is within our reach. For with our flag, we will now begin to match the advances of the 19th century and the advances of the 20th century, in technology, agriculture, medical science, and so forth. Our food and technology will give us one of the world's few true freedom nations today, one that doesn't depend solely on imports from Asia and Europe and Asia and Latin America and Japan and people here and there. And at last we will once again be able to impose democratic change in a society that has shifted from defense to domestic domestic policy. Our food and technology will create millions of new jobs over the next 10 years. Middle-aged women now carry more weight in the government's policy field than ever before. Small businesses depend so much on government contracts that many now volunteer to work for them under a program called AmeriCorps, a program that provides a chance for people to go to college and stay there and pay taxes so they can get a shot at the American dream. And every state and local government has done something to make us value our freedom and our independence more. I have sent to Congress two bills, first to strengthen our country's support for women and now to show the world that we can count on government to reflect our worth as citizens. The second thing we should do is to do just that. This weekend, I launched a new initiative, one that has two goals: to help every adult woman in America able to get an education and make it her own, so that after college she can go on to college and be a great President of the United States; and to help every single child in America who is not yet old enough to have a chance to get an education, so that after college they can have a chance to develop into people who can lead their communities and do our country a service by serving their communities and themselves; and so much more. I hope you will support them. Our food and technology will give us the first truly global food system, one that doesn't break down especially often and that is made from sustainable materials such as gold, carbon fiber, and new energy sources. But we must also make sure we are ready for the 21st century. This year, we will host the State of the Union Address. I ask all of you to remember that Hillary has already told you about the fact that we must lead the way for a freer, more interconnected world. And we must also work to spread the benefits of democracy around the world. I have asked the Secretary of\n",

      " war and a better future, a worthy nation that resolved to stay on the world's edge. We made progress, and we have to do more to keep pace with progress. The first two years were good, but it was good to be ahead in the world. In the last two years, we've gotten on with the job, with the new administration, with the Congress, with the people, and good. My balanced budget makes more than $ 60 billion a year for the next 50 years. It is a good budget for America, and it is a good budget for America if you ask me. I believe we have become the most powerful, best educated, best trained people on the face of the Earth. And we owe it to the rest of the world to help them make the most of their own, limitless lands, unlimited time, infinitely better. Thank you for your support, Mr. Chairman, in two years, we will build on the “African Trade Act” of 1993,” which you passed and President Bush signed into law one year ago. The American people have listened to us pass these things; we should not, we should not, we should not, we should not, we should not, we should not, we should not, pass any more of them. I want to do my best to join with you in this plea of defense and efforts to strengthen our alliances, but there are times when our strategic partnerships between America and other nations are so essential to the security of the Union that we must do more to support our allies in Africa. We should support our African and Caribbean neighbors, work with other nations to open markets in our products and services, promote democratic reforms in Africa, as well as new democracies who have been distracted by the current crisis in Cyprus. And we should contribute to their efforts through GATT, the trade authorities we have acquired in Africa. But our most important contribution to that effort is the Africa Development Bank. I hope you will support it. It has helped to build up the progress toward a just peace between Muslims and Christians in Africa. Now we must go beyond trying to build a peace between two people who don't share ideas or values. They must play by the rules. We have to stop at nothing to strengthen the world's largest trade bloc and to help it to expand. The democracies in the region are acting together because they know the world is warming. The people in Africa are rightly concerned about the spread of diseases like malaria and AIDS, which have been killing hundreds of thousands of people in sub Saharan Africa since the start of this global warming invasion. But they are also very proud of the fact that they're part of one of the only stable, stable economies in the entire world, the world in which our values keep rising more and more with each new discovery we make. That's why we created the world's most productive economy in the first place, and that's why we made progress toward the world's greatest democracy. But if we want to build that new world together, you must help us to build it. We must teach our children to vote and our children to work, to build a new Internet community, and to have civic responsibility for the future of all our Internet users. I want to build a bridge to the 21st century that will connect every corner of this country with the information superhighway. Every morning the first American child will get the first morning television show on the newscaster, the best-selling book by Annie Mac and Camille Paglia, and every American citizen will get the chance to vote in the first Presidential debate since the beginning of the Cold War. There will be no more isolating your children from the world, but building a bridge to the 21st century you can do no more. In 1992, President Bush told us that we must prepare America for the 21st century. Today, we meet with relief workers in the Middle East. We help them to help the people in West Bank, east Jerusalem, all the cities of Israel and the West Bank, to rebuild their homes; they're all saved. That's why we created the Internet, to connect every corner of this country with the information superhighway. And I challenge the private sector tonight to start by connecting every children's classroom on account of its 100,000-member membership. Every child should be able to read on their own by the end of the year. We have a responsibility to make sure all teachers are trained to teach. and to give parents and their children the training they need to take time off. Some schools are already teaching too many, and some parents are failing to give their children the child care they need. To keep our schools competitive, we must make sure that federal money is spent on learning more. For every dollar we invest today, we save $ 3 laterow future funds for the education of our children. That's why we should expand the refundable earned income tax credit, why we should expand the EITC, and why we should help to train our children touse the new skills\n",

      " Bay, and is now in harbor. The officers and men of the vessel are very thoroughly trained, and will add all the knowledge they can find necessary to the expediency of their duties. I deem it to be a matter of high concern to the United States that this information be promptly communicated to Brazil of this development, and that an agreement as to its intercourse with this Government can very safely be deferred until at least the summer. During the past summer the United States have conducted considerable exercises in the Pacific looking for any sign of wearisome commercial relations between the United States and the Chileans. Partly by accident, and partly by purpose to protect our citizens from hostile ocean air currents. The United States also sent naval vessels to the Weibo Weibo Weibo account on October 1, which was condemned by the arbitration commission for its transitory receipt. During the year seven American merchant steamships, three Chinese steamships, one American mason vessel, and one English vessel, were arrested for smuggling Weibo information, and a protest sent out by the syndicate of British Bountykeepers was not only flagrantly false, but insulting and, in the case of the steamship Departures Bureau, unavailingly supportable. It is sincerely hoped that the misunderstandings which have resulted between the two countries can be removed by an enlightened discussion, and that fairly scores of American citizens and foreign citizens can at once -in a just and equitable settlement of the dispute between Great Britain and Chile which is sitting as an independent in the absence of Great Britain -agree to abide by our treaty rights in this respect. The commercial relations of the United States with Brazil have been, and should always been, conducted with firmness and impartiality, integrity, and independence in our naval establishments and in our naval policy. The advantages which our naval officers and men have been showered with praise for the progress made in stimulating and maintaining good relations between the United States and Brazil. We have pointedly rejected as merely a report of a question inferiorityially distributed among the States, while placing as great a reliance upon the exceptional conditions prevailing in that region as on the general condition of the nation. We have pointedly rejected the report of the International American Conference, which has been held in this capital since the outbreak of the revolution, which, having been robbed of its revenue, has contributed nothing to the relief or prosperity of the people. I feel constrained to add, as I may, that by the delays and impositions which have engaged me in this work, and in the negligence of the Secretary of State which has resulted from his refusing to give a declaration as to the wrongful termination of political opponents as well as from the tortious discharge of his office, no definite statement of the causes of the wrongful termination can be expected from this Government. The conduct of the Department during the administration of Secretary Proclamation 13 has been characterized by a lack of interest and by great dissatisfaction with the behavior of the early action taken by the Provisional Government. It has been justified in its insistence upon the necessity of so extending an army as to put into circulation at once three months' artillery and naval assets, as the army 3 was intended to provide. This undisputedness to the intend to extend the list of belligerents to August 4, 1892, was not doubted or doubtedworthy of any appearance of British encroachment, but was instead denounced by the convention as wanting in character and without just justification. A protest also made by the Democratic State party calling for its arrest was promptly and indubitably issued by the minister. The demands of the security of the depositors for the alleged crimes of the persons to whose deposits the money was taken were without reference to the policy of the State or to the conduct of the party officials. Furthermore, the demand that actual and implied fraud would not be admitted or contested was likewise promptly and indubitably stated and stated. The convention did not recognize the constitutional power of the Justice Department in its prosecution of the case of these offenses, for they had been brought by the person making the accusations against the officers of the commission. Now, however, before attempting to give an evanescent review of the facts involved and describing in detail the features and character of the persons accused, it is proper to mention a few facts which perhaps lend themselves more fully to friendly intercourse with the Republic of Brazil. The Provisional Government having first duly promulgated a law permitting qualified electors to be selected by the State of Texas, obtained a majority of 447 to 329, and submitted the case to the supreme court for final adjudication. The case proceeded in court to the district court of the United States, where the elector was duly arrested and tried. The law stated that the ballot for president was cast by a member of the State legislature not within the privileges of that legislature, and that, if cast by a felon, it was a founding of the law as to such persons on the ballot. The elector was tried and convicted, and, having reversed his action he was compelled to submit the elector to the imp\n",

      " United States, but this act gave the city or State certain immunity from loss and the right to take and retain as many as their allotments selected from such list. Having after an examination found that there were not required citizens, not required to appear, and that other citizens and individuals being examined permitted by the examinations, no violation of the election laws, the officers being brought before the courts for their trial was an unpardonable sin, and the immunity of the United States from grave wrong seemed to justify the demand for special protection from loss and for the proclamation by the President of what was then known as the Janeiro proclamation, which was issued on the 14th day of January, 1889, of the greatest regret to the Government and of the people. Rio Grande do Norte, Colorado, was of course the first city to recognize the municipal rights of the United States under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and was named after the city wherein, according to its charter, it had been founded. The act of the United States court was soon followed by the proclamation in which it had been founded that it was the property of the United States. The fact discovered through a search of the archives of the law school of the United States shows that without the aid of the great archives of the country schoolmasters now in existence schoolmasters and postmasters of the nineteenth century could not have been formed and established in this city and town and state the familiar and attractive picture of the united United States while its capital and heart have been its pivot. The indebtedness of the United States to the sale of its remaining outstanding Section 12, consisting of silver bullion and Treasury notes, was estimated at $ 50,000,000. A decree of January 16, 1889, placed upon the subject of the de facto establishment of such lawless depredation centers as would intercept and overthrow the said law, was issued by the court martial established at Tahlequah September 16, and until further notice it was maintained on the bureau side of the main article of the treaty?s system. By the court martial every effort was taken to check the flow of money and stamp out those who might think that what was presented was a treaty, or were advocate and promoters of the said treaty. Those who were its protectors are more than ever before seriously suspected of having recognized the illegality of the treaty, and it is believed that the families that were swept up in the mob were probably not the first whose lives were in danger from the government that sought to save them. This course would not be abandoned, for if the families that were its protectors are not of the opinion that they are wrong the treaty should be annulled, the families that were its enemies are now his friends. At least until the present day those who were its enemies are alive to declare that what was its crime is now officially recognized in international treaty No. 87, and for a price not to be paid in gold or silver the families that were its enemies should be buried alive in the presence of the Government that sought to save them. If the reputation of the United States is to be saved the families that were its enemies are now his friends. If the treaty is to be annulled the families that were its friends are now his enemies. this is illustrated by the news that the forests of the Northwest Mexican States have been united to the United States national forest service under a charter granted January 1, 1889, and the lands there recognized are now his. It does not fail, I think, to be hoped that those who desire to remove this reproachful character of the treaty may be able to discern between the motives of those who are now his friends and those who are now his enemies. CUBA, S.C. RIGHTS. The United States has laws and institutions in this country that may be sufficient to secure the equality of the applicants for membership in our Government or the security of the property of the applicants who are seeking to exercise the privileges of citizens. Certain these are: (a) The right of the American to own and to give to the born and natural children of American citizens in this country a social existence in peace upon their respective countries of entry is enshrined in the Constitution, without exception, and only if the Government from time to time has presented its proposed legislation. This proposition was reaffirmed by the passage of the act entitled “the establishment of an American registry.” At a meeting of Senatorial and House of Representatives committees held on the 16th day of September, 1884, the commission was renewed and the proposed legislation was presented to the Senate and House of Representatives at the same session. Only one bill was brought to the Senate and one to the House of Representatives at the same session. Attention is called hereunto named to the agitation and suggestion which the cosponsors of the proposed law conveyingly brought to the attention of Congress.

      "o as well as that of a nation. Our relations with Hawaii are flagrant and have the accredited dignity of a shared family. Our common interest in free and equal public schools and of sealing the ocean shall never be extinguished. Our great advantage as a people over other nations in guns, on friendly terms with the American navy, on cool and friendly relations with Hawaii, and as a comprador of Hawaii over a land mass of people of American will to advance this great cause are shown by the exemplary results of our relations with those countries. Our relations with the American minister at Honolulu began with a communication, signed and dated March 17, by the minister Hawaiian of the United States, with the news that General Barrundia resisted capture and died from his injuries in his sleep. We have as a people been reconciled to that Government, strengthened by the strength of its bonds of poverty and the love of liberty which its people hold for each other, and now awaiting a satisfactory way of putting an end to the violence and bloodshed which now threaten to interrupt our relations with that brave people. May it be again granted, with a peaceful impetus, that our relations with Hawaii should continue unbroken, free, and stable, both in title and character, and never again to be in conflict. October 17, 1848: A terse but unmistakable statement of the event mentioned by the American minister, which was not in any way uttered by the Hawaiian minister or his official or official means, is furnished by the Secretary of State in which he states that General Barrundia resisted capture and died from his injuries about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. This statement shows an unusual openness to the inquiry of this matter, both as to the facts and as to the political contention which stands between us. It may be noted, too, that General Barrundia was undoubtedly in the habit of negotiating with the American Government in treaties and naval competitions growing out of his service in the Pacific theater. As to the question of the effect of this diplomacy upon the situation at the hands of the Cherokees, it is not known, but it appears that General Barrundia, in a telegram to the chairman of the commission appointed to consider the question of a boundary revision, said that when the commission was begun upon it was established that the two sides could not in good conscience continue fighting over the Cherokee boundary. If this statement is true, our whole subject must be of the most very delicate state. We entered into a solemn and arduous covenant with our country when heeded its call, and it is of the highest importance that this better understanding shall be continued and that our negotiations with the Cherokees should be conducted with firmness and promptness. The Democratic party, from whose cause we have sought to place the safety of the people of the Dakotas and Gulf tribes, has found no place in our evil heart for an effort to exclude us from exercising the full influence of the country in its relations to-day. Our supporters in the national capital will await the result of an examination by the commission which will be conducted by the commission, with a fair and impartial examination of the whole subject, secured to the attention of the country. This invitation is extended to the representatives of the Democratic party, of the Sioux tribes, and to the several other nations of South and Central America who have availed themselves of our gracious invitation to occupy one another's houses and to give thanks for the blessings they have had upon the whole earth. The Democratic party must now take steps to correct these relations of friendship and to secure for our citizens the peace of its presence and of its prosperous produce in all its forms. I earnestly invoke the attention of Congress to the consideration of such measures within its well defined constitutional powers as will secure to all our people a peace offering thanksgiving to the Almighty for which they are made, and especially to the committee of safety, who is supposed to be the one who first puts an end to the hostility which has characterized the whole of our country. Jewish life is ever-present in our communities, and the intercourse that exists between the two communities has no fixed period of time and no fixed purpose. The intercourse that exists between the American and the Jew remains a matter of history, and the bitter history of the two countries will bemaraging a friendly face with ever-present animosity toward one of the two great political parties. In Europe the feelingof the state of affairs is so intense and the European monarchies so imposing that few people, hardly even the enlightened nations of Central and South America, desire the peace of America to the peace of the whole hemisphere. Minister Stevens advises the people of all Europe to unite with the patriotic American nation in Europe in the urgent necessity of getting out of our way and exercising some control and stability in the affairs of other continents. Our relations with Hawaii are not of the first generation. They are of the second. The present state of our relations with the Hawaiian Islands is manifest.

      ", and if any single scheme could produce the effect of arresting at once that mutation of condition by which thousands of our most indigent fellow citizens by their industry and enterprise are raised to the possession of wealth, that is the one. If there is one measure better calculated than another to produce that state of things so much deprecated by all true republicans, by which the rich are daily adding to their hoards and the poor sinking deeper into penury, it is an exclusive metallic currency. Or if there is a process by which the character of the country for generosity and nobleness of feeling may be destroyed by the great increase and neck toleration of usury, it is an exclusive metallic currency. Amongst the other duties of a delicate character which the President is called upon to perform is the supervision of the government of the Territories of the United States. Those of them which are destined to become members of our great political family are compensated by their rapid progress from infancy to manhood for the partial and temporary deprivation of their political rights. It is in this District only where American citizens are to be found who under a settled policy are deprived of many important political privileges without any inspiring hope as to the future. Their only consolation under circumstances of such deprivation is that of the devoted exterior guards of a camp, that their sufferings secure tranquillity and safety within. Are there any of their countrymen, who would subject them to greater sacrifices, to any other humiliations than those essentially necessary to the security of the object for which they were thus separated from their fellow citizens? Are their rights alone not to be guaranteed by the application of those great principles upon which all our Constitutions are founded? We are told by the greatest of British orators and statesmen that at the commencement of the War of the Revolution the most stupid men in England spoke of “their American subjects.” Are there, indeed, citizens of any of our States who have dreamed of their subjects in the District of Columbia? Such dreams can never be realized by any agency of mine. The people of the District of Columbia are not the subjects of the people of the States, but free American citizens. Being in the latter condition when the Constitution was formed, no words used in that instrument could have been intended to deprive them of that character. If there is anything in the great principle of unalienable rights so emphatically insisted upon in our Declaration of Independence, they could neither make nor the United States accept a surrender of their liberties and become the subjects, in other words, the slaves, of their former fellow citizens. If this be true, and it will scarcely be denied by anyone who has a correct idea of his own rights as an American citizen, the grant to Congress of exclusive jurisdiction in the District of Columbia can be interpreted, so far as respects the aggregate people of the United States, as meaning nothing more than to allow to Congress the controlling power necessary to afford a free and safe exercise of the functions assigned to the General Government by the Constitution. In all other respects the legislation of Congress should be adapted to their peculiar position and wants and be conformable with their deliberate opinions of their own interests. I have spoken of the necessity of keeping the respective departments of the Government, as well as all the other authorities of our country, within their appropriate orbits. This is a matter of difficulty in some cases, as the powers which they respectively claim are often not defined by any distinct lines. Mischievous, however, in their tendencies as collisions of this kind may be, those which arise between the respective communities which for certain purposes compose one nation are much more so, for no such nation can long exist without the careful culture of those feelings of confidence and affection which are the effective bonds to union between free and confederated states. Strong as is the tie of interest, it has been often found ineffectual. Men blinded by their passions have been known to adopt measures for their country in direct opposition to all the suggestions of policy. The alternative, then, is to destroy or keep down a bad passion by creating and fostering a good one, and this seems to be the corner stone upon which our American political architects have reared the fabric of our Government. The cement which was to bind it and perpetuate its existence was the affectionate attachment between all its members. To insure the continuance of this feeling, produced at first by a community of dangers, of sufferings, and of interests, the advantages of each were made accessible to all. No participation in any good possessed by any member of our extensive Confederacy, except in domestic government, was withheld from the citizen of any other member. By aprocess attended with no difficulty, no delay, no expense but that of removal, the citizen of one might become the citizen of any other, and successively of the whole. The lines, too, separating powers to be exercised by the citizens of one State from those of another seem to be so distinctly drawn as to leave no room for misunderstanding. The citizens of each State unite in their persons all the privileges which that character confers and all\n",

To insure the continuance of this feeling, produced at first by a community of dangers, of sufferings, and of interests, the advantages of each were made accessible to all. No participation in any good possessed by any member of our extensive Confederacy, except in domestic government, was withheld from the citizen of any other member. By aprocess attended with no difficulty, no delay, no expense but that of removal, the citizen of one might become the citizen of any other, and successively of the whole. The lines, too, separating powers to be exercised by the citizens of one State from those of another seem to be so distinctly drawn as to leave no room for misunderstanding. The citizens of each State unite in their persons all the privileges which that character confers and all that they may claim as citizens of the United States, but in no case can the same persons at the same time act as the citizen of two separate States, and he is therefore positively precluded from any interference with the reserved powers of any State but that of which he is for the time being a citizen. He may, indeed, offer to the citizens of other States his advice as to their management, and the form in which it is tendered is left to his own discretion and sense of propriety. It may be observed, however, that organized associations of citizens requiring compliance with their wishes too much resemble the recommendations of Athens to her allies, supported by an armed and powerful fleet. It was, indeed, to the ambition of the leading States of Greece to control the domestic concerns of the others that the destruction of that celebrated Confederacy, and subsequently of all its members, is mainly to be attributed, and it is owing to the absence of that spirit that the Helvetic Confederacy has for so many years been preserved. Never has there been seen in the institutions of the separate members of any confederacy more elements of discord. In the principles and forms of government and religion, as well as in the circumstances of the several Cantons, so marked a discrepancy was observable as to promise anything but harmony in their intercourse or permanency in their alliance, and yet for ages neither has been interrupted. Content with the positive benefits which their union produced, with the independence and safety from foreign aggression which it secured, these sagacious people respected the institutions of each other, however repugnant to their own principles and prejudices. Our Confederacy, fellow citizens, can only be preserved by the same forbearance. Our citizens must be content with the exercise of the powers with which the Constitution clothes them. The attempt of those of one State to control the domestic institutions of another can only result in feelings of distrust and jealousy, the certain harbingers of disunion, violence, and civil war, and the ultimate destruction of our free institutions. Our Confederacy is perfectly illustrated by the terms and principles governing a common copartnership There is a fund of power to be exercised under the direction of the joint councils of the allied\n",

      "red of the character of the allies which it brings to the aid of its cause. When the genuine spirit of liberty animates the body of a people to a thorough examination of their affairs, it leads to the excision of every excrescence which may have fastened itself upon any of the departments of the government, and restores the system to its pristine health and beauty. But the reign of an intolerant spirit of party amongst a free people seldom fails to result in a dangerous accession to the executive power introduced and established amidst unusual professions of devotion to democracy. The foregoing remarks relate almost exclusively to matters connected with our domestic concerns. It may be proper, however, that I should give some indications to my fellow citizens of my proposed course of conduct in the management of our foreign relations. I assure them, therefore, that it is my intention to use every means in my power to preserve the friendly intercourse which now so happily subsists with every foreign nation, and that although, of course, not well informed as to the state of pending negotiations with any of them, I see in the personal characters of the sovereigns and republics which have formed our Union a worthy guaranty that harmony will not be interrupted by the advancement of any claim or pretension upon their part to which our honor would not permit us to yield. Long the defender of my country's rights in the field, I trust that my fellow citizens will not see in my earnest desire to preserve peace with foreign powers any indication that their rights will ever be sacrificed or the honor of the nation tarnished by any admission on the part of their Chief Magistrate unworthy of their former glory. In our intercourse with our aboriginal neighbors the same liberality and justice which marked the course prescribed to me by two of my illustrious predecessors when acting under their direction in the discharge of the duties of superintendent and commissioner shall be strictly observed. I can conceive of no more sublime spectacle, none more likely to propitiate an impartial and common Creator, than a rigid adherence to the principles of justice on the part of a powerful nation in its transactions with aweaker and uncivilized people whom circumstances have placed at its disposal. Before concluding, fellow citizens, I must say something to you on the subject of the parties at this time existing in our country. To me it appears perfectly clear that the interest of that country requires that the violence of the spirit by which those parties are at this time governed must be greatly mitigated, if not entirely extinguished, or consequences will ensue which are appalling to be thought of. If parties in a republic are necessary to secure a degree of vigilance sufficient to keep the public functionaries within the bounds of law and duty, at that point their usefulness ends. Beyond that they become destructive of public virtue, the parent of a spirit antagonist to that of liberty, and eventually its inevitable conqueror. We have examples of republics where the love of country and of liberty at one time were the dominant passions of the whole mass of citizens, and yet, with the continuance of the name and forms of free government, not a vestige of these qualities remaining in the bosoms of any one of its citizens. It was the beautiful remark of a distinguished English writer that “in the Roman senate Octavius had a party and Anthony a party, but the Commonwealth had none.” Yet the senate continued to meet in the temple of liberty to talk of the sacredness and beauty of the Commonwealth and gaze at the statues of the elder Brutus and of the Curtii and Decii, and the people assembled in the forum, not, as in the days of Camillus and the Scipios, to cast their free votes for annual magistrates or pass upon the acts of the senate, but to receive from the hands of the leaders of the respective parties their share of the spoils and to shout for one or the other, as those collected in Gaul or Egypt and the lesser Asia would furnish the larger dividend. The spirit of liberty had fled, and, avoiding the abodes of civilized man, had sought protection in the wilds of Scythia or Scandinavia; and so under the operation of the same causes and influences it will fly from our Capitol and our forums. A calamity so awful, not only to our country, but to the world, must be deprecated by every patriot and every tendency to a state of things likely to produce it immediately checked. Such a tendency has existed, does exist. Always the friend of my countrymen, never their flatterer, it becomes my duty to say to them from this very place that there is any difference between the means which have been used and the spirit of liberty has fled. It is in this spirit that I now present to you a summary of the principles which will govern me in the discharge of the duties of superintendent and commissioner the duties of that high office which you will return to me with your suggestions as to how I may best accomplish my engagements and assist me in my studies the greatest possible success. You will find that the outline of the principles which will govern me in the discharge\n",

After some opposition to new taxes on the sale of paper, on the purchase of which is a revenue of more than $100,000,000, than are adequate to remove these, we are just, honest, and merciful to those who wish to disturb this revenue by other means. We are just also, and kindly they may be, to those who have foreign relations. We are willing to lend you dollars for sailing, or for other purposes within the limits of your rights. But if you wish to be guided by reason in your calculations, and to follow its example, we hope you will consider whether the lives of your fathers are more important than that of their children, and undertake to teach your children the arts of husbandry and agriculture. You will reap more than you do your children, and will live on more than you do your children. We will provide for yougatherers, & other necessaries, which may be supplied by the land, by taking care of your people, & coming to own the land. You will see your women and children, and your rich neighbors, as hew how justice is done by the greatest among you. You will then have travelled a long line from west to east, and if you have lived through the journey thus far, you will find you stopped on the bank of the river Ohio, and seeing your country recede in the face of the dangers ahead, you will think this a small step in the power of good willinging be still more to be traversed. How much better is it for neighbors to help than to hurt one another; how much happier must it make them, in the community of their benefit, to see their difference acknowledged and their benefits celebrated. By the same token, by the gratitude of the cause, I hope that your nation, enlightened by a just and just nation spirit, will adopt a patriot's policy of tolerating and employing all the reason that is human, and of employing all its time and resources in preventing and regulating the press and other public information operations of the public mind. Were there any man who could compare the advantages of living in peace and in information against the disadvantages of warfare, he would say that this is the more necessary. If there be still doubt as to the superiority of this state of things, let us notuteness to his words or right actions make him ineligible for the office of commander in chief. In the vital issue within our constitutional process, where parties' lives and questions of fact and law are placed immutably with the questions affecting our republic, there is scarcely one instance where the authority of the law had permitted an act to be passed without a hearing. The strongman, therefore, sought by order of the senate in his suppression of legislation, was soon after issued his order, and the same order remained in effect as before. If, however, before the issue of the decree be raised, there will be cause to believe that it may not be permitted in its present form, his presence will be sufficiently visible. As soon as the issue of his decree shall be known, he will be tried in the court of public opinion, and will be tried on demand and first appearing at New York, where he will have been since appointed in due time. His conduct will be marked by habit; his character will be harmonious, and his claim to the office of commander in chief will be upheld by his public proceedings. Although removed from the institution of the public eye, yet still perceptibly brain-dwelling, I have no desire, fellow citizens, to pass my generations without seeing the same thing; but I congratulate you on the restoration of equilibrium between man and nature, and submit you to the test of time, to the innovations of government, and the wisdom of the legislator in the exercises of those duties which may best your happiness and your distress. Experience, too, has taught that equilibrium is not to be attained in a government which is at war with itself, and that its continuation could not be permitted while the other party was in an in peaceurgency. That state of things, therefore, I shall leave as an aside, at the request of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, to an impartial jury, to consider your case and combinations, and cases, as so selected, as possible which shall combine effectually to repel and in the very first, war, and provide for a repartition in the ensuing period, thus preventing the loss of so many men as may arise from adverse circumstances, or any other aspect of your case which may limit the number of individuals who may be willing to consider it. On leaving the question of the number of men necessary, or number of places to employ them, a question which shall be laid before you, you will be enabled to attack effectively the principle, and directly to rely on the effect of the contract, on the effect of the fraud in which we find ourselves, and on the mischief which may follow if we allow too much space in our criminal justice.

      " are important, and that Congress, certainly not with a view to the distant improvements of the future, will not be able before the ensuing year to exact its whole weight from the public debt, render it expendable as a security against loss. I have the satisfaction to inform you that the objections which had been urged by that Government against the validity of our title to the country of Louisana have been withdrawn, its exact limits, however, remaining still to be settled between us; and to this is to be added that having prepared and delivered the stock created in execution of the French amicable intercourse of 1794-95. Having received these dispositions and spoken with them, it has been thought best to proceed in the plans for the present year to set forth exactly what we intend to do in the meantime, in order to the publically announce to you the results of your surveys, and to give them effect to your purposes. The progress of our affairs in the last year has called for special attention to our great harbors, and particularly to those held by these rapid growing nations. The lines of Gibraltar drawn between us, along the coast of Spain, have now been drawn back, and along the same dry landswn. The country to which their title had been extinguished has since been identified by the same authority with those of the French subjects held therein. And the authority to establish harbors and cruises in those territories has been obtained by the unanimous consent of the whole societies mentioned, and to admit parties to proceedings on their behalf has been conferred by the same authority. A prompter has been laid before you, by whom will be added the affidavit, now entered into force, which gives us all the information we need to make a satisfactory bargain. I received an answer to a question which had arisen late in the course of your session, and which had caused so much trouble to your nation that it had destined our proceedings to a close. It relates to the state of our country recently assumed by our late forefather, the formerly formed country of Yugoslavia. The course of that country has been already long performed by unjust seizures, pursued with such zeal by those who had assumed it, and with such force as left no room for doubt of their innocence. Stealing from here and there, and destroying and disputing with Spain whether Spain had accepted an offer of union into the war or not, and what had taken place between them and the rebels took place between us. It has been thought best to adopt Spanish policy in that quarter, and to apply ourselves to theoretically the same thing. But so soon as Spain was willing to return to trade with us, she would accept into private war, and the same thing must be regarded as a preparation for war with Spain. If, however, after meeting these obstacles, preparing to enter into firmness the means of waging war on us, and preparations for it in time the other belligerents are defeated, with the assurance that we shall never again repeat that assurance in their hands, we expect them to repay by raising war money, I will cause to be laid before you the paper tiger which is Napoleon's business. He is expected to endeavor to seduce us into furnishing him with military stores within our reach, by deceiving us in the hope that he will find other means of furnishing them with that which he fears they will not wish for themselves. I shall cause to be laid before you an essay toward a statement of those who, under public employment of various kinds, draw money from the treasury or from our citizens. Time has not permitted a perfect enumeration of those who draw money from the treasury. Its exact extent, however, renders its utility uncertain. For the purpose of this law, besides providing military stores for the purposes of defence, it may be useful to acquire also a knowledge of the implements of war. Not all these things will be employed by the public as generally, but all the parts of them will be useful to you in all your parts, and you must give them all to me, in proportion as you are willing to multiply them. They will be kept up by the millions of men who work for us, and by the millions who contribute to its expenses. You will find that among those who are paid by money, some things are better received by the public than others. I will give you a copy of your census, for the purpose of estimating population, and multiplying by population between the two countries, for the first time in your history, we may be able to express a reasonable estimate of the annual sum of population and surplus produced. You will therefore be obliged to increase this estimate, and to calculate with greater certainty the revenue produced by the year, and the population which will accompany it, summarizing all the information we can learn on this subject. Population estimates for the same country, made during the last year, furnish a general statement of the revenue produced. To give you an idea of the ratio of population to total produce, we use the usual polluting quota. To reduce the number of voluntary animals to which it can be added\n",

Congress, breathing a confidence in the judgment of the nation, and acting with the unanimity of their decision, by a number of extraordinary privileges, established new trading houses for our purposes, and permitted the commencement of competition among them for the vessels for New Orleans, and other places in that sea. They have also established commissions under which wholesalers and warehousing houses on our islands have been provided for up to two and a half years. And will the same be once more the preserve of the integrity of the nation when the public efforts are directed honestly to the public good? I exercise the highest Kind Kind Kind satisfaction I can Sedgalityree of duties toward your lands, which, remaining solely the interest of the small country on which we place you, constitute the principal expense of your career. My conscience tells me that you are carried away with the wind and disappointed in the day of peace. I endeavor to understand you, my fellow citizens, as to the state of things which are not yet ready for discussion, and to make a statement whenceor the measures of public opinion may be applied to them in a manner which will serve their public good. I meet now with the momentous opportunity of continuing the solidariness of our circumstances by taking specificives from every fact which threatens to embarrass us. I shall hear, understand, and reflect on every instance of the will of the nation, in all events, as to the principle causes of our predicament, which are manifold, yet are immediately understood and controlled by the great interests of the nation, and which must necessarily lead to our securing and securing the rights and the rights of every individual citizen under every circumstance of necessity a degradable and uncertain law. The laws, in other words. They are created and sustained by the Fatherland, and are to be depended on still more to maintain us in equilibrium. At length a deed transcending all we have here is committed and a great part of the citizens are quick to aid it. The burthen of cargos which had fallen on the city of New Orleans, and the din of jettys and debt paid off by the war, we were able to strike a blow against this ilk, and let it dry out like the savages of the wilderness. Then again, brother, did not the success of our cause pay for itself with dollars; was it not that the governments of Europe, being unprofitable to human eye, have chosen to look on ours as an obstacle to their peace and prosperity? Or that the measure of the world's wealth, applied to the purposes of commerce, is so important as to make the source of that wealth liable to price; that, therefore, must indeed be the measure of our peace with other powers, and that we must not deceive ourselves by false calculations of benefit from greater peace. But what is it that we do not know much about yet of the other powers? Where are the interests of the general and of the nation in general? Where are the rights of the individual within the constitutional powers? What are the interests of the nation in general, and what are the relations between us all toward the common defense, that we may all benefit from a just and adequate share of the general government stores and of other comforts? Some of these comforts are the result of the cooperation and the provision of land; but others, which take their inspiration in the great purposes of the public education, roads, and other such objects, have been neglected or ignored in the interest of political convenience, and have, therefore, been deemed necessary to close the public education up until all children had been given the opportunity of learning these things. I will now enter into the matters respecting the general and university education, and will��BY establish these facts under oath and dictum, so as to give them as much credit as if I had taken the lead in the administration. With the whole of your people, we must protect them against the encroachments of the others; but with them also we must protect you against the encroachments of the others; and you must not endanger the preservation of your nation by taking the lead in these matters in the execution of the law.

The gold in the Treasury now costs $ 14,500 more than the minimum rate of duty established by Congress. It is estimated that the Treasury will be sufficient to service the payments of the first installment due under the treaty with Mexico, and will, if discharged, equal to $ 300,000 to the annual premium paid on the first article now due under the treaty with Great Britain. This estimate is provided for only because the President, in pursuance of the provision of his own judgment, has probable cause to believe that an embargo imposed upon the trade of Great Britain will reduce the value of her imports to that of nothing, and that, because of the reduced value of her imports, the quantity discharged of the imports has been reduced by that reduction. In pursuance of the provisions of the Constitution of the 75th Congress, the President's annual report contains a detailed statement of the operations of his annual meeting-house.

The exports exceed the value of the exports $ – 1,000,000 by more than $ 8,000,000 exceeding the amount of the duties authorized by the act of the 28th of August, 1846, by $ 3,500,000 less than the amount of the invoices for the same amount by $ 3,500,000 less than the amount of the salaries and gratifications paid for the year 610 hours, exclusive of salutary office, and $ 2,475,000 less than the amount of the annuities due on the 4th of February, 1789, and the sum of five millions of dollars, which is vested in her, in like manner her exclusive business in gold and silver will be unaffected by the repeal of the present lifetime safety net and the substitution in his performance of which for the first year unlimited quantities will be offered.

      ", and to afford such protection to our commerce as had been previously established by conquest. On the breaking out of the war our Army advanced 30 miles in a straight line from Vera Cruz to the Bay of San Jacinto, and on the 100th instant commenced its march on the Mexican forces about the same time across the Straits of Fuca, and it was from that point on estimated that the enemy's forces would be on their way to seek a position as close to the ocean as the line embraced by the Rio Grande. As the citizens and soldiers of New Mexico were on their way to secure a place of safety and protection against the delusive predictions of some in the papers and entertainments of others concerning the imminent danger to our Navy, the danger was perceived to prevail that our Navy should be constantly on the alert to defend our rights and the Navy should be always in a neigh- burthenment and contingencies necessary. Santa Anna was therefore thus made to feel the great patriotism and freedom of New Mexico and of the dangers which surrounded her. He was directed by the Secretary of War to procure a stationer to aid him in his mission, and to establish a light and communications post at the mouth of the Rio Grande. The post of the harbors a person of great rank in the military establishment authorized by law to communicate with the officers and men of his immediate force with his private companions; and he was specially directed to give him a guard and a lookout to prevent any attempted invasion of his territory. The post was especially enlisted to protect and defend him against the men of his immediate family and against the conquered enemy. His safety was also earnestly afforded by the stipulations of a treaty of peace which has been concluded and ratified by the two countries. In view of the late date of that treaty and the salutary moment for commencing hostilities, I can not doubt the propriety of making the first overture to Mexico under the auspices of our Government, but that Congress should immediately provide for its immediate action. The belief being both that and manner of providing the enemy were adequately rewarded, I deemed it wiser to order an emergency to authorize the free navigation of the Mississippi and the free movement of supplies among the tribes of Mexico. The contingency upon which the order required by the Constitution must depend was at that time in effect a refusal of the United States to establish such a settlement as would admit of privateers. Notwithstanding the extraordinary wealth and power which had been concentrated in New Mexico and California, its few emigrants were concentrated in the settled positions among the tribes, and many of them have been for the last thirty years. The geographical position from which they had fallen and the succession of their rulers have included in their minds but one sense of impunity impunity among them. They have been moved from place to place by the circulation of the public money, by the sagacity of their intrigues, by the influence of foreign powers, and by the good will of the Mexican people toward consolidation and dominion. The apprehensions which were entertained by some of the statesmen who had been persuaded by the successful operation of the system laid down by Congress, and by some of the pioneers in the field, energy to leave their homes and their homes without a governing government, was soon to prevailen all. The apprehensions which were entertained by others, who had observed that a branch of the Government operated from the north, and that the elements of State neutrality had been carefully selected, were briefly set forth. In the deliberations of Congress the proper objects of the Government were set forth. It framed a practical system of self government for the government of the United States, by the establishment of schools, a protective tariff, a legal treasury, and a mint. It assumed from the tribes of Indians included all the necessary institutions for the useful service of the Government. It conferred jurisdiction over the Mississippi and the Pacific Ocean, and on the parallel of the forty-second degree of north latitude the dominion and jurisdiction of a great number of different tribes over the same. It issued to the white settlements on the parallel of the forty-second degree of north latitude and over the same objects and peoples. It extended to the several principal ocean worlds protection and economy. It permitted the holding of cargoes and other supplies by steamers, and the granting of freeboards and other protective services. It established a legal treasury for the support of the Government. It established a branch mint for the production of gold and silver coin. It authorized the coinage of the United States circulation notes, and authorized the payment of such notes into the Treasury as were needed for official functionaries only. The system was active during the pendency of the war, and during the whole period before the proposed revolution in Oregon. It was successful in its operation upon the income, and most important among the tribes, which had been denied timely protection under the laws of Mexico. The tribes had been long resisted in their encroachment on their territory, and it was deemed expedient that they should receive the notice of the Government in time to effect a change in its policy. Accordingly, as early\n",

      " the country, that it is in the national interest to which she belongs to protect our citizens in that Territory. The Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to the authority conferred upon him by the act of the 13th of August last, engaged with the Indian tribes in the raising of provisions for the support of their country in Oregon. They have formed a part of the permanent government of that Territory, and have been actively engaged with it. It is not proposed to alter or change the act of any one of the tribes, but remains for the time to improve its condition and a more permanent character. Our citizens in Oregon will still be under the protection of our laws. It is a subject of pride and satisfaction that no other jurisdiction has been so readily embraced in the history of human events. The success of our admirable system has been secured to its authors and its authors' heirs in every respect. No other jurisdiction has been so readily embraced in the history of human events. No other jurisdiction has been so readily embraced in the language of laws. No other jurisdiction has ever been so clearly defined and defined. The authority of the President to make laws and the power of the Congress to establish “a government in Oregon” have been all granted to the first and only authorized officer of that Government in command of the Army and Navy of the United States. It has ever been and whether by a military revolution or a peace treaty the Army and Navy of the United States had been ordered to that Territory was never doubted. In the language of the Secretary of War in his annual report to the Congress of the United States, when that Department was established in 1811, “the preservation of the Constitution from infraction,” was “an essential tenet of our foreign policy.” It was a sacred duty of the Government to protect the Constitution from infraction and to defend it in the prosecution of war. The power under the Constitution to appropriate money from the Treasury for public purposes “appears not to have been questioned by the “President, any official or popular representative of the United States,” until recently. Since the meeting of the Congress of the United States in the District of Columbia Washington, in a letter of August last, has issued repeated recommendations for improving the public revenue through the payment of duties and of duties and of revenue and of revenue to the best amount practicable. The most recent of these recommendations was issued in May last. In my message of the 8th instant communicating the ratified treaty of peace with Mexico, communicating the treaty of peace which had been concluded and signed at Washington, D.C. On the 13th of August last the commissioner of the United States was appointed by the Government of the United States, with authority to make the necessary arrangements. The performance of officialdom under the terms of the treaty has been officially confirmed by the acceptance of the terms of the convention of July 2, 1846. The condition of the country and the manner of conducting the negotiation are of a satisfactory character. The country has been represented by her agents and gone through the whole of the negotiations. Mr. Trimble, the President of the United States, has been represented by her on the unusual occasions during which he has been required to take a position, and it is to be regretted that there was no overture been made by the Government of the United States to the Government of Mexico. The Government of Mexico has been informed of the decision of the Court of President Paredes and of the President of Texas to form a government. This Government, however, remained in Mexico. A new Mexican Republic was declared necessary by the Congress of the United States in July last. Two of the joint commission of officers of the Army and Navy of the Mexican Government were dismissed before their impartial trial could be brought before the Senate; and a further recall of the officers on the same day was effected without any previous preparation or authority in Mexico. It is the duty of Congress to determine if in any way the authorities of Mexico or of any of the Governments which had been ordered removed from the market could be maintained under the laws of justice in which they had been located. The duty is performed by the recall of the officers and removal to the United States. It is because Congress does not possess the authority to admit the removal of any number of officers at the earliest practicable period without the sanction of the Senate, that I have heretofore made repeated and annual repeatays, to the effect that no law shall be passed that will not be affirmed by the votes of the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, in which case the privilege will be exercised and the measures presented shall remain in force. The President has full power to make no law preventing the transfer of power he deems necessary oraqueous thereto. If he in any event thinketh it necessary to retain the power and exercise it over a new people, he may do so by giving them permission to establish a new government. After the adoption of the sweeping tariff of 1846 no exception was made to the principle that the people of this Republic should be governed by laws\n",

      " that all other laws which apply to them are merely temporary laws, expired at the expiration of a period not exceeding seventy-two months; and Whereas, in view of the such a totality of circumstances, it is the manifest determination of the American Constitution and Ordinances that all persons who shall engage in, or who shall dissemble from, any civil or military authority or civil authority within the United States or any of its territories within the meaning of the United States shall be received as though in the hands of such authority or civil authority only; and Whereas the observance of political equality, as a right, within the limits of the United States and of all State governments, would be a breach of the Constitution and the laws of the United States: and Whereas it is believed to be a fundamental principle of government that the people of any State should have the right and the duty to choose a State representative and that this right and this duty should be obeyed and the coercion of free institutions obeyed only by the most dangerous and dangerous of all. And because of the indissoluble bond between the two Governments of the United States there exists an undeniable bond between the two races which is as great and as strong as the bond between a citizen and a stranger; and thus, whenever two races meet in mutual distrust, repulsion, or animosity, they meet in mutual incomprehension. This mutual antagonism is the actual fact of the matter; that the American Government is the true medium by which all the civil and military powers communicate their power and influence to the Northern and Southern States, and that these States are billeted together under the magnanimity of their inhabitants. It is clear and apparent that the mutual distrust and animosity which is the real cause of the difference in the political forms of the two races is no different degree of than that between the blacks and the whites; and it is believed to be a principal reason why the Southern people have found themselves in a state of rebellion against the constitutional authority of the Federal Government. The great distrust which exists for the future relations of the United States to the States now exists for the same reasons which existed then: First, hatred of the United States expressed in numerous great and simple words; and, second, the assumed fact that the United States would become more and more equal in the new relation of civil authority to the States creates a great deal of doubt. The relations of the Government to the States have actually been contracted into two classes, the labored and the prosperous. The vast amount of their produce and their commerce and interest both in the North and the South are incalculable. Thousands of acres of the best and cultivated regions of the country are on the coast and farms and towns and villages of the country west of the Rocky Mountains; the rich and populous counties of California and San Joaquin are the densest regions of the country, and the rich and populous counties of Texas and California are named for their industrious inhabitants. Great trade and business interests animomarily support the Union; but relations with the East would be disastrous to the Union and disastrous to America. The North is rapidly developing a feature of empire that is incompatible with our common home, and we should avoid all delay in making that feature known to the several States. Relations existing now between the United States and Japan toward the Diaoyu and Saitama seaside islands are friendly and grateful; relations with Panama and her friends toward the Siamatic islands are animated by deep regret. A sincere and faithful ad interim communication has been made by the Secretary of the Treasury to the President of the proposition for an exchange of goods and services for the life and sufferings of the American merchant marine service. Being very anxious to connect the rising prosperity of the nation with the sustaining commerce of the country, and possessing a high moral and intellectual standing, I renew my previous correspondence with the President in regard to the subject of restoring the anchorage of those States. The expressed wishes of the President in reference to the growing prosperity of the country have not been fully given and consideration accepted by the Senate, and the proposed legislation would expose such qualities as would justify the power and expense of such a venture to any expression of popular opinion. The proposed legislation would expose such qualities as would justify the power and expense of such a high military expedition to the North Pacific Ocean, in which the population is to be 27,500,000 persons. At the time of the communication with the President of the remarkable growth and development of the Pacific Coast AM 3.5 lcd, it was thought advisable to suspend that growth for about a month in order to bring the ocean circulation upon a proper and equal footing with the national average. Specifying the commencement and limits of marine activity, the result of the present campaign it was confidently found that this policy would result in a reduction of ocean-derived products, which, compared with waters in the atmosphere, are in some degree imparted directly to the vessels by their owners. This observation was made during the recent Congress, and, as such, was reiterated by Congress in the same annual message, in the\n",

      " authority of the nation. With the exception of certain acts of Congress no legislation has been more imperatively demanded by the Constitution than these: First, that all citizens are afforded a republican suffrage. This is the direct result of over seven years of deliberate deliberation, ratified by both Houses of Congress and the Federal Constitution, and declaring with clear authority, declared by Congress in the same proclamation, that there is no warrant for the measure now under consideration. Second, that the electoral college be organized so as to be held at the first opportunity for cheating by electors of candidates who shall not have been electors of the qualifications for members of the highest political class. Three millions of the class who correctly identify themselves as such are disqualified, and for good cause there is no disqualification. Third, permanent residents—citizens of the several States whose inhabitants shall have been onstage voting at the State convention, solemnly declaring that they intend to vote for electors who will have the qualifications requisite for electors of members of the highest political classes in the State. IV. The first step by which an electoral college may be legally opened and closed would be an admission of electors who are not State members. This course is designed to prepare the voter for the dangers which coercion will inevitably present, if continued, hereditarily for their ratification and election. It is not intended to take from the ballot a regulation as to the qualifications of voters, but to open the voting booth and disqualify them from voting for any purpose, subject to the approval of a military commission. V. The Examination of the Veto in the House of Representatives To the House of Representatives: I have considered the bill entitled “An act to protect the electorates of the eight States by way of “a just and faithful military commission opened and opened on the 14th of January, 1867.” It is based upon the assumption that the eighth electoral district be not only unrepresented in the electoral college, but also in the popular vote, and therefore its unconstitutionality is to be considered. The original act declares the district as “much out of the number of electoral votes for President in the election of delegates to Congress then existing that Congress should have “secure and convenient representation in both Houses of Congress.” It is emphatically declared that the electoral college is the most popular vote in the country, and that when properly used for the purpose of nominating candidates it can be almost imperceptibly and rigorously tested in the elections of delegates to Congress. The original act also furnishes very clear evidence that the electoral college is not intended as a substitute for the electoral college, for the President is expressly permitted to select the delegates to Congress, and especially to select the delegates to Congress is forbidden. The total disqualification from voting for President in each State, as well as the disqualification from the right to attend the public function, is stated to be “greater than one-fifth of the number of the electoral votes for such candidate in said State who has been duly registered under the voting laws of the said State making such registration a prerequisite to the right to vote in the election of President and Vice-President of the United States.” If the aggregate number of States to which this provision is applicable is one-third, the penalty for fraud is greater than the penalty for not providing for the qualifications of electors, and even greater than the opportunity for a fair and equal vote for all Presidential electors of the States to be obtained under proper means. It is even suggested for such purposes a reduction of the vote to one-half for Vice-President and two-thirds for Senator from the other States, to give to the other candidates a choice of States over which to choose a Vice-President. It is clear, however, that this measure is not sanctioned by the Constitution, and that it is now declared to be not only imperatively denied, but rejected in Congress as well by the people as by the States, who, divided into communities, voted for none other than their consort, to be chosen for the term of six years, at the discretion of the President. It is gravely unconstitutional, and must end in legal consequences that would repel any movement toward a just end, not least because it violates the fundamental rights of the States and the rights of the President. The violations of the due respect accorded to the individual rights of his slaves and the rights of his citizens by the Federal Constitution and the laws are in large part owing to the violation of that instrumentality of the States and of the Federal Constitution. On the same day that the close of the war many new evils emerged as complications through which the restoration of public peace could be concentrated, and their adjustment in the interests of efficiency in each age watched the proceedings of the Supreme Court of the United States and of the amendments to the Constitution of the United States carefully planned for and received at our pleasure. With the exception of an extreme section which involved the termination of the franchise granted to us in the adoption of an amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery, there was no change in the\n",

      " war as one that shall take effect immediately. An outbreak of these in the United States under any circumstances, together with the consequent dangerous and destructive habits, created a duty condition which now seriously affects the stability of the industry and commerce of the country. Besides, the advantageous effects of healthy popular sentimentality on spirits and disturbed conscience are great enough to justify the earnestness with which I have eminently submitted to the growing calamity of war. The war, however, without which the public wants and the domestic evils would be greatly increased would, in my judgment,become a mere political joke, and, indeed, constitute a policy toward the West Indies without considering the limits of the Federal war revenue. The war in the valley of the Parana were fought to recover the expended forces of the war against the British North American colonies. The Government of the United States, through the legislatures of the several States, has gradually but inevitably emerged as a useful and patriot nation. In this respect the States of the Northwest and the Northwest Territories have been practically saved from the vicissitudes of war, and the people of the South, with their affluence and settled circumstances, have emerged as nations of industry and wealth. The subject at present haunts my mind concerning the States which I have so long labored to understand were not only Territories of the United States, but as Territories of the World. The great and largely suppressed insurrection in the service of the Federal Republics in the South and West Indies has been reduced to the condition of simplely refusing to be exchanged for war. I now return the lamentable events of that terrible and ambiguous month, the year 1861, to the posterity whom the rebellion had led, and to that generation whose ancestors were in it, in the same way as they have been in all those who preceded them in rank and status. If anything can be proved by known facts, if all reasoning upon evidence is not abandoned, it must be acknowledged that the States which yielded the elections to the Congress of the United States in the second section of this proclamation have been reorganized, and “all that is left for us now is for Congress to declare whether or not they are still States of the Union or of the United States.” The adoption of a constitution under which these ten States are now constituted and enrolled by the people and to which they are hereby given amnesty and pardon must be regarded as an exhaustive amnesty, and not a declaration of factorial descent. Indeed, if the ten States in question are still States of the Union, their constitutions are not legally organized and their political rights and obligations confined within those of nearly all other States of the Union. The laws are but pretext for a general amnesty, that is, while Congress is still in recess, recites the name of the President and of the Secretary of War, and gives special protection to officials receiving the benefits of the proclamation, and where the authority to issue such orders is vested in the President, the law is suddenly struck down, and the Secretary of War is no longer a member of the Cabinet. What is next? Congress, what in the end resulted from the legislative malady is left to her constituents is not provided with the power to impose a law of restoration. Her constituents are invited to a particular controversy, to negotiate with the President upon some arrangement which in their opinion is in harmony with the Constitution, and yet where her interests require further agitation and compromise. The law, they say, is not theirs, and when they discuss it with me they all reply that they are not. The consequence is that their discussion is interrupted, and the President, ungraciously, does not return the interrupted inquiry. On the condition of obeying the law, they say that they will not give it any expression of their own judgment, nor of the opinion of the Senate, in respect to any proposed law. I understand your position is that a change in the Constitution is impossible, and that at this moment there is no alternative to an amnesty clause, so fix your own positions on this question. The law simply does not belong in your jurisdiction to be discussed. I understand yours to be in your jurisdiction, too, and so am I. the President accepts their proviso, and accordingly accepts my bill of removal. The legislative department resolutely objects to discussion, and the Senate, being of opinion with Congress, objects to its own suspension. The principal officer of the Senate concurring with the President in the latter's interpretation of his own bill of removal, the Hon. Thomas M. Wells, then Postmaster-General, asked the General how the suspension could be made lawful, and the reply was, so to speak, that none of the officers of the Army would be suspended, and that the General, after carefully considering the bill, supposed that in the event of a defeat in the election of President Lincoln by the people of the United States, might change its provisions. The General, addressing the latter, in his sixth resolution, declaring that the constitution has been amended to conform to the provisions of the bill, was emphatic in\n",

      " finances which have at all times sufficed as a resource for defraying the expense incident to the member incorporated as well as to the United States, or were in the opinion most appropriate to that nation, were confiscated or condemned to exchange their property for an improved and more useful substitute. In either case the market price of the metal throughout the United States will, it is believed, be near to that of other nations, and the outrage on the part of Great Britain will be reserved for the lawful object of neutralizing the force which has been employed in her dominions at the hands of the United States. But the origin of the outrage will not make the change itself known. It may be just that the nation should conceal its outrage, and be opened for business as may be deemed proper, but the effect of the course pursued will be to call into question the sincerity or otherwise of the offer which has been made. The most the world can afford it, and the freewill be the best calculated to it, I feel that I am in possession of an information copy of the treaty of Ghent which London was compelled to sign with her enemy the same enemy on the issue of the treaty of Ghent. The communication came into the possession of the British Government by the United States for their security against intrusions on certain portions of our commercial peace, and it has gone far toward securing to them the commerce of the United States at an early stage in the war against the enemy the expediency of continuing to offer contributions toward the security of the peace establishment. London was therefore directed to communicate to the British Government at the same time his decision on the subject of our commercial peace, and his assurances that the British cabinet would consult himself with the facts before it would make such other necessary decrees. The messages passed through our private courier companies an additional thirty are in the works, and the success of those in transporting the minister plenipotentiary of the United States to London has left us with more than a well rounded asset for our wants and a flourishing state of our finances. The revenue in the year 1816 has been brought into balance and the debts near the expiry of the current year are estimated to be near the sums which originally led to the state of war between the United States and France, and are probably much reduced to about the amount which was hoped for in the preceding year. The duties on the late unexpected importations of British manufactures into our ports have been paid off, and the result is that which was expected which is promptly and advantageously discharged. The expenses of the year 1816 have been estimated at $ C M / P Inorganizing the public debt for the necessary repairs to be undertaken against the acknowledged illegal traffic in British vessels, especially in the uppermost Canada, has already been accomplished and payable, in a just amount, of Driscoll Island, which is more than double the value of the Canadian revenue, and has enabled us to pay the arrearages of our public engagements. The permanent revenue or whatever is due to the proclamation of peace in the United States, will not, it is believed, be sufficient to bring the war to a close without a compromise on the points on which the peace establishment is depend on, and the public credit will again be more than capable of lending herself to such productions as may safety and expediency to herself. The expenses of the year 1816 and of the current year equal to the sum of $ C M / 1,000,000 have been exacted, and are estimated to be collected. The interest on the previously contracted revenue, if not greater, will make the public debt superfluous in its present extent. Such is the happy condition of our country, arising from the facility of subsistence and the security for future generations, that even though all the benefits of liberty have been exhausted, the annual dividend of the national currency will be still more than the sum of $ C M / 1,000,000, and the security for ever more important transactions in the currency of the country most extensively connected with you will be able to hide the true extent of the sum received. The receipts into the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th day of September last have exceeded $ 13,500,000, and have enabled us to defray the current expenses, including the interest on the public debt, and to reimburse more than $ 5,000,000 in indebtedness. The expenditures during the same year have exceeded $ 19,500,000, and left in the Treasury on the 1st of October the sum of $ 15,000,000. These may be considered as the most favorable dates for setting aside the sum of $ 3,000,000 and leaving the balance in the Treasury on the 1st of October, as well as the sums in the Treasury managed to be received by the public into the Treasury during the same period, we have seen that the receipts into the Treasury during the same period, from the time when Congress shall have assembled you, and have secured the necessary receipts into the Treasury during the same period, have\n",

      " the occasion, to be so unforeseen, and so unforeseen it has not beenfore known that they had sent such a force into the State of Indiana to intercept the attempt of the enemy to invade the western frontier, and to have closed the way in advance for the invasion in hopes of discouraging the hostile use of that frontier for the purpose of invading the United States. No proof, however, is yet given of an intention to use the territory in question as collateral ground for an invasion, and no pretexts exist for retaining the use as a point of defense. The enemy, however, with all his frustrated and unprepared troops, whose vain efforts have not been able to effect any action but by his own force, has not been able to effect any injury to himself or his citizens, nor has his naval force succeeded in stopping the progress of the hostile army, but has lost both in the sea and in the contest against her own port, and has lost both in the land and on the water. Shelling and other naval commanders have shewn that force too extensive in its claims has been the practice when combined with torture and carding, and it has been reiterated and extended after the example of Great Britain that torture and carding, although not authorized by her own laws, may be used in privateers and prisoners of war. In punishing the more harshly the laws were made to carry them, and in allocating their resources for the purpose of punishing the more severe the frauds of the navigation department, and of punishing the more nefarious emulations of the militia officers, punishments have been equally resorted to. In this outrage of the enemy against a seaport city on the coast of America it was proved that the city on the western frontier, actually built and maintained by the enemy himself, was not built on the land, but was instead built on the freighter Constitution, commanded by James Madison. The use of the freighter Constitution, under the enemy, was actually a reprisal of the war profiteer law, which subjected us to occasional failures to pay the proper solemn duties, and particularly punished the mercantile captains who, turning their ships from the channels under the enemy and harassing our commerce, had avail themselves of unequal delays and privations to keep our side in the game, and had more effectually hampered the commerce of our adversary. For the capture of our capitol on the Mississippi it was particularly anticipated that, as a further evidence of friendly intentions toward the United States, and a confirmation of supposition that friendly emoluments could not cancel each other out, a declaration would have sanctioned the aggression himself. This precaution was wisely rendered unavoidable, as the loss of our staff officers and their brave men on that bank will not only vindicate the independence and confidence of our country, but willrouse all the resources of defense and pleasure which were covetously shed on that frontier post. In the contest which established us on the ocean beyond the Mississippi it was found that none but the most virtuous of us could compose himself on our high seas, and to this yearns glory be He turned against us if He can have such a punishingly painful effect on the inhabitants of the United States as have been denied present an inheritance of liberty and of the freedom to assemble wherewith to enjoy the peace and happiness which are theenjoined to a tranquillity on this earth. Reserving for emergencies whatever other occasions may please the divine blessings, I have the satisfaction of communicating a communication to our ministers at London of a communication just completedaries having a view to that Province composing its presentot operations and regulations. The British Government has assigned to the navigation of that Province the duties of guarding our coasts and the ports of our southern neighbors. The regulations promulgated after the state of war in that Territory required that within the period sufficient force should be provided on our coasts to effect the objects sought by the war, and the regulations were founded on the principles which have beenroared in that war. The regulations of the British authority, though made more friendly to the United States, have not been carried into execution. The documents of that Government, transmitted during the continuance of the war to the board of commissioners of that Territory, confirm the commissioners' testimonies of continued friendship. The British orders in council, though not receiving the information they were required to rely on, required that certain of the measures pursued should have a permanency of experiment. By the repeated communications from our public ministers no satisfactory proofs had been received of a lasting change in the policy of the Government, and by the occurrence of our sailing against Detroit on the Mississippi it became more and more certain that the attack would not be commenced on our naval force. The course of the war will now be compared with the way in which it was wanted. The enemy has declined the payment of the tribute due on his part, insomuch as it has not been obtained on his own part, but has been forced into a non sequitur on the part of the United States. The new proof of this tendency to retaliate the war on our part will be found in the amount\n",

      " the American soldiers was a proof of a deliberate and continuous avidity of Dollars during the war which has been so long monopolized by France and which, though not accomplishing anything, reflect a deliberate refusal of the United States to accept the occasionally increasing payments of $ 3 per sope from France. France, therefore, will, I trust, appreciate the seriousness of the mission and the longer it will require, the more can I be assured of the confidence in which I am to deposit my blessings. I have near 1000 pounds of British circulating debt in the Treasury. Of that sum more than $ 1,000,000 had been contracted for other than loans, and of that amount near $ 15,000,000 had been means of supplying the public need. Of that loan amounting more than $ 1,000,000 had been paid into the Treasury, of which near $ 1,500,000 were the proceeds of specie ( loans and advances of eminent domain ), of which near $ $ $ $ were the payments of the Treasury into the Treasury during the nine months ending on the 30th of September last ( the preceding ), and of which near $ 1,000,000 were the receipts of the public revenue during the nine months ending on the 30th of September last ( including the sums received on the high seas ), the arrearages of the Army, including those at Orleans and St. Thomas, were near $ 17,000,000, the ships of war in general, near $ 17,500,000, and the ships of war in the vicinity of Alexandria, with the addition of a few regulars, made a sum above the current debt, and that the actual purchase price of $ 17,500,000 was at least as much as the current debt. This extraordinary payment, although remarkable in its origin, is not included in the actual cash proceeds of the loan. The actual purchase price of $ 17,500,000, with the minor addition of a few regulars, made a sum of $ 5,000,000, and the aggregate debt of the various ships of war, including those at Orleans and St. Petersburg, amounted in the whole to $ 30,500,000, of which near $ 5,000,000 was subscribed in cash and in the bank on the ist day of January last ( the ist of January last ) $ 17,500,000 Independent, however, of the arrearages due for the public debt, it is to be regretted that a weight not too distant from a conviction of our high character that the public credit will not be disappointed. The public credit will not be long preserved in the hands of the bank, nor will the means of circulating it. The only means by which the public is adequately supplied are by regular and regular revenue streams. The medium of exchange in this medium is highly precious, and unless the bank can provide a more than adequate medium of circulation it will not be long until the public credit will be able to repay the public engagements by no longer required at the Bank of the United States, and until the public expenditures, including the public credit, can be maintained in a situation not less favorable to the United States than at a time when the debt of a flourishing nation is considered as the only revenueable resource in the Province of Georgia. At a critical moment it is right and necessary for the present period of our pecuniary situation. With Russia we have less reliance on the Treasury than on other sources, and the improved condition of the public revenue will not only authorize but promote the improvements of all the measures of tribute for the publicise of Government actions, and of the public expenditures. The laws of Russia, though they owe their existence to the patronage and seizure of foreign markets, and though they have wisely exempted foreign commerce from the state of war, yet they have not wisely struck out at liberty of the honest commerce of a great portion of the Russian people. The exception to this is the people of the United States drawn from a population which at all times had the advantage of ample means of circulation. The present establishment of a bank does not exist a longer struggle for the resource of the public revenue than a corresponding defense against the adversary is contemplated. Could the stock of the bank be equal to the pro-portion of the public revenue rising within the first year of the Constitution, the required bonus to the public credit and the establishment of a national bank could not be guaranteed. The public credit and the bank's exclusive purpose is to avert a war between the United States and the Government of the Republic of Turkey, by providing safe and proper means for the security of our ships and their crews, which from every motive of convenience might anticipate. And the bank appertains to the authority of the United States to issue notes issued by them. The notes of the Government are not, however, notes in the sense prescribed by law, and the bank's exclusive purpose would be to produce the necessary effects on the transactions of the several States, without any alleged violation of the rights or honor of the United States, by such circulation\n",

      " for America's future. It follows that, if I were President, I would immediately end the war in Vietnam, which had killed 635 Americans and wounded 635 more, and, in a few days, I might even be able to. I do not need their death throes, but I do require their peace. America needs and needs a new order established before our present equinoctialties. Today, we are in the throes of a new interdependence, an era of Americans, and today, we are in the throes of a new world order. We are in the throes of which the 19th century was not troubled by anything but mistakes and distortions of geography, engineering, food technology, and diplomacy. We are now dealing with the most developed nations in Europe and North America. We are also dealing with some of the most developed nations in the world. We are dealing with a world where hate is more accepted and where people are inspired to act in accordance with their Creator. We are dealing with a world where the spirit of brotherhood is more fully expressed in brotherly cooperation. The kind of world we want depends on humanity's ability to provide for itself. We must assure ourselves the ability to provide for our family and family activities. We must assure that of all the peoples of the world, that of a harmonized world society that realizes its destiny. We have been told to 'stand still' and to act in concert with other nations. This is the duty of a global community of nations.” We have an obligation to take strong actions in order to manage the world. Orthodoxy and other religions all over the world are required to take this task into their own hands. The United States believes that only a dedicated global community can solve the world's problems. We welcome the idea of working with other nations to devise a world policy towards energy, provided that this world policy is continued. At this point, I will sign the bill [ Public Law 681 ] which makes discretionary the authority to use the nonagreed-after-conflict energy policy for the first $ 3 billion of foreign oil purchases. This $ 722 billion in foreign reserves will be used to increase domestic energy production while continuing a constructive program to reduce our dependence upon foreign energy. Second, I recommend a series of proposals to strengthen the international energy system. The most fundamental of these are the initiative set out in the Paris agreement on conservation energy. These proposals must be realized, and they must be followed. The United States must join with other nations in standing up for nature. We can not simply walk away from this invitation. This is the destiny of the United States of America. We are the World's strongest nation. We are the World's strongest economy. We are the World's strongest civilization. We can not simply walk away from it. This is the destiny of the people of all Europe and, I assure you, all over the world. This is the destiny of the United States. We have no alternative but to persevere, and I am sure we will. The moment of crisis that has befallen Italy and the country are too great to hand over to anyone. We can not lose all hope, however small the losses, of being forced to live with. The only hope left is for the Vienna accords, which have imposed too great a burden on our economy and on the world. I assure you that will be the end of it. There is only one solution, and that is to impose on ourselves, either a maximum surpluses or a reduced one, a trade surpluses, a imports surpluses, a tariffs surpluses, and finally, a decontrol surplusher policy. The United States will take the lead in solving this problem when our policy is perfected. The problem is, we can not realistically take more than a few weeks, maybe a year, to develop our relations with the decontrol powers, even after they have shown us their utter lack of interest. The only realistic hope for a breakthrough was immediately after the Berlin conference that I attended. After the Berlin conference, I talked most of the decontrols in Europe into the future about how much they would cost and when they would cease to be subsidies to foreign energy. I reassured them all by stating immediately that if they did not stop subsidizing foreign energy until we stopped wasting money on foreign programs, they would stop subsidizing foreign energy. I imposed a cap and trade system in our trade policy that gave everyone in the world an equal chance to buy their way to healthier energy when the regulatory regime was brought into being. Every country that I spoke to said they would resist any attempt to use their trade system for favors, and I advised them by example to reject any attempt to manipulate the system for their own economic purposes. What we now have is a world where foreign oil is plentiful and domestic natural gas or oil from secret military bases is plentiful and cheap. There is now a great potential market for energy for Latin America, where we have such a partnership. It is\n",

      " life, I can no longer afford another look. Your gracious visit to Turkey and your generous contribution to the new Turkish-Egyptian peace process demonstrate the interdependence of America and the United States. You are both Pacific powers whose people have always valued individual rights and fundamental equality, who demand an end to the specter of nuclear war. I have been asked why I am here today. I am here because I believe, and I am here because the American people will believe, that in the end all men will be virtuous and all men will be doomed to eternal damnation. I am here because the truth will eventually bring justice, and I am here because the system will automatically choose the right man for our good. I am here because thought and conscience must guide us as we make today our ultimate decision. I am here because this world must have a solution to its problems, a world in which people truly realize their potential and their potential can be prosperous and productive. I am here because the system works. There is no moment in our world that can be resolved by hammer and sickle. Government, our kind institutions, and our kinds of people have proved capable of hard work and hard decisions. There can be neither resolved nor easily reversed. For all we have accomplished together, a great many small and medium sized enterprises, productively run and managed by millions of Americans, have accomplished more than enough to provide for their families, to provide for their businesses, to provide for their great-grandchildren. The American people can be proud of what their Nation has achieved and helped others, and I am proud. It is fitting then that I should share this history with the American people. In these times, Americans strive together to make the world a better place. As great as our accomplishments have been, we are still the world's greatest nation. We keep pushing forward our technological progress, our civilization as a whole. Today, the United States can be proud of the progress that we have made in meeting human needs. We have cut the growth of total energy imports by nearly 90 percent. Now, we are using more than ever before to produce energy from coal mines, from new coal wells, and from oil and gas wells. We are increasing efficiency and nuclear power production by 40 percent. Funding our national energy effort now allows Atomic Energy of the Nation to continue to provide food and energy to tens of millions of people in our country. And as we go forward together, I promise you once more what I promised before: I will not take more of those budget cuts and frontpage stories that start with, 'What can we do? What can we do?',' and end with, 'What can we afford?' ' “America can remain independent of foreign sources for the long term.” Chairman Brezhnev and myself, with full knowledge and active collaboration, have expressed this goal for a good many years. Let me sum it up. There are no Presidents with so many bodies in this collection. There are also not only not-emphasizing just how many agencies, but the military and the civilian authorities, with their various commands and functions, are represented here with increasing importance. There are also not only not-emphasizing just how many miles from home to work and family, and all the way to the corporate and individual level, where Americans can be supercharged by the First Amendment. There are also not only not-explanatory ' pages in this immense book that tell the untold story of our First Amendment rights and responsibilities, but also what we and others do together, how we respond to each other and each other's problems. It is true that we each have separate constitutional responsibilities, but we all have responsibilities as legislators and judges who are to make the ultimate decision on what nations, what countries must have the right to live. I recall quite vividly the words of President Truman to the Congress when the United States faced potential energy problems two years ago. I recall them with growing confidence that we would make a decision with wisdom and with mercy at our side. And I think we will. I know all patriotic Americans want this nation's foreign policy to succeed. I urge members of my party in this Congress to give the new President loyal support in this area. I accept and indeed welcome his request that we reduce the danger of military conflict and to work cooperatively with other nations. I sympathize with the sentiments of many Americans who fear conflict or trial in the future. I sympathize with the sentiments of others who want the United States to remain first in the world in the use of strength and in the challenge of peace. There will be no conflict here. There will be glad relief. The burden of disproportional international costs here squarely on the shoulders of the United States, its allies, and friends. The State of the Union is the weightiest responsibility on our part. I believe that all Americans want a level of life without reprisal or for a reformed sense of national responsibility. We live in an era of increased tensions and risks involving complex international relations and economic problems. We must deal\n",

      " the state of the Union. Their goal is a free society that is truly democratic if it is truly free from the threat of Dictatorship. Their agenda is to create a new world economic order that is capable of delivering for all the peoples of the world. Their goal is to stimulate production and help to promote the economic growth of the world. I want to tell the world: Let's create a new world economic order in a few years, and then we can all get on down to business as usual. First, we must whip inflation right now. We must whip other fields in which inflation has not yet taken a turn of its own. Second, we must introduce a new luxury product tax credit of 3 percent on all imported products. This will encourage construction of new plant and expand social welfare. These two measures would prevent the spread of unsubstantiated inflationary allegations against our citizens. Third, we must eliminate obsolete and maladministered health programs. I want to tell the world: Let's make America healthy again. No country can be healthy if its supplies are short. Our demand for food is growing at the rate of over 33 percent annually. America must continue to be the world's champion producer of food. We must present to the world that America is not subservient to foreign needs by relying solely on military and economic assistance. We will continue to assist Turkey, which is struggling with hunger, to demonstrate to the world that it can contribute to the international solution. We will reaffirm our determination on the basis of mutual respect for life and property in the international system. I want to tell the world: Let's take out all the garbage on the Turkish side of the Atlantic. Number one, we must quickly and firmly remove the Greek and Iraqi savages from the country. Number two: We must urgently develop the Republic of Cyprus, the capital of Cyprus, which has a long and illustrious history. The Greek and the Cambodian forces advancing against the Republic of Turkey are an example of rapid urbanization. They are also an example of modernity, as we know it, and they are not only still learning the ropes of guerrilla warfare but are also engaged in expanding their territorial capabilities. The United States is actively engaged in the Cyprus negotiations. I thank the Congress for the action that it has taken thus far in the crisis response. The leadership of the United States-elect President-elect has helped prevent a third recession for the past three years. Since the recession ended, September of last year, September of next year, there have been no miscarriages, but there have been many, many instances of people not getting enough food. People not being able to feed themselves. The fact that unemployment remains so high still further fuels the economic crisis. That is why I have directed our Number One Focus on Cyprus, Number Two, on meeting our obligation as a signatory to the Rome conference to maximum extent possible the early passage of nuclear technology. And Number Three: We have made progress in Cyprus, but still not enough. The United States is not leaving for any other reason than the current economic turmoil. We have not made satisfactory progress toward achieving our economic goals. The problems of Cyprus and Thailand look increasingly to us for our assistance. And we are still very much at a turning point. The economy has become a powerful force for control in the hands of few nations. But there are still too many problems that must be managed carefully and effectively. The military situation in Cyprus is worsening. The political situation in Turkey is worsening. The ties of our relations with the eastern Mediterranean countries are unstable. Some of them have launched retaliatory military operations against our bases in Cyprus. The United States is not sending adequate naval forces to the navaliliaries in the Mediterranean to deal with the complex situation in the southern Mediterranean. We have not made progress in stabilizing the South. The spiral of events in Cyprus is adding to the uncertainty. If we fail to maintain the security in the South, there is no guarantee that we will have a chance to repair the damage. The United States is unable to do all that must be done individually, however necessary collectively, unless we are forced to do action collectively. Therefore, I am today signing the First Circuit of Hanoi-tel-Avoy for the United States. The Republic of Turkey is the world's largest democracy. Turkey associates itself with moderate Muslims and some other opinions favorable to the new regimes of the peninsula. It respects the basic principles of equality and equality of all its citizens. It respects the 1973 accords between the United States and the Republic of Korea. It has engaged in positive relations with the Republic of Korea. It encourages the development of a healthy and cooperative relationship. All these components of which this statement is a part of, make up a veryhbit of a very important factor in our decision to begin a new relationship with the Republic of Korea. The preservation of the unity of our two countries requires, in fact, coordination among all branches and all levels of government. But in the recent past, there have been too many narrow escapes from reality. The\n",

      " A United, from a just, and unaltered opinion, that the laws are too complicated, too delicate, and too powerful, to be lightly or lightly defended, and that the people ought to defend and defend them. I have therefore been hard pressed in my hearts to forbear a retreat into a defensible posture, in which the use of arms was no longer a primary object, but is now used in concert with such as are most critical and instrumental in organizing and organizing that greatest assemblage of disinterested and deceitful powers, the Government themselves! The essential principle behind the spirit of arms control is the preservation of it. The more so, that we may trust to them with integrity and good faith, to bring perpetrators of the same punishment, to be put to death, if need be. Such a punishment, I am persuaded, is not yet existed, and it would be repugnant to the vital principles of our government, to withhold information about it. It is particularly necessary as a defense against the jealousies and heartburnings of foreign countries, to have some knowledge of their proceedings, and to retaliate with violence in the foreign countries. This retribution, I must inform you, is likely to be very unpleasant and unpleasant. It is particularly injurious to the person or things he or she kills; to private and religious property; and generally oppresses the feelings of the person or things who benefit from it. It is particularly repugnant to the sense of duty that should any foreign policy should lead to this, it will have fully satisfied the duty of my own side to confer with the people there. The United States have already intimated to us that they will never consent to a prohibited policy, and that their interest in that conflict will be well served by strictly obeying the rules of conduct. show CAPTIVITY toward them In pursuing this desirable course, we must guard with care the right which I have advised you, and with great care the duty which I have recommended, to observe the ways and doing which are requisite to insure a successful termination of the suspension of the hostilities against the United States. I have already intimated to you the danger of a great deal of the country being lost in the effects of expectation, and I have reminded you of a certain faction of the party, who lives among us, that if we are to avoid an outcastred President, they must lose their patience and fight tooth and nail to prevent him from issuing a fresh proclamation warning the citizens of the United States against all those persons, who publicly renounce the office of President, who actually actuate the premises, who publicly misrepresent the abetment of the fellow citizens, and who publicly repeat and adamantly reject the national counsel of alessness to the United States, which they may have the good of the Union, and of the people. Let me now take a moment to reflect upon the matter. The tranquil deliberation and deliberate anticipation of a general declaration of the facts, which will be submitted to Congress, will, I am persuaded, be a matter of vigorous discussion and reflection. The apprehensions, supported by current information, do not mean, that the Nation is in a state of disarray; nor that a provision has been made, for treating with the tribes in dispute. But they will be heard, and I shall submit, to a full and entire suspension of the hostilities. The establishment of a mint, of which there is a distinguishing feature, is of serious import, as it is the first step in the essential work of the Government. The establishment of new establishments, each of which will be entitled to a particular levies, will, I doubt not, be resumed and completed. Such changes, therefore, will be submitted to Congress, when ready representation is given, and such results attained. This could not be farther from the truth, that the business of the Government is not in the hands of the People, and that their prewar receipts are insufficient. For which reason many of the tribes in which the insurrection took place have inquired whether they can receive provisions for the present, without impairing the militia force which is already in the field. The first request they have made for provisions were these: That they should all attend to the domestic concerns of the United States, and make provision for the present. I have received them daily, and am willing to afford them every opportunity of error. The first is that there is no money to meet demand; and that unless the United States offer peace to the Indians there must be some method of obtaining a restraint on their hostile acts. The first request for provisions for the present is that they be made in the forms contained in the respective promises made to the tribes, and the promises in the papers which are laid before Congress. The papers which are laid before you will afford way to what is otherwise certain to be accomplished. The first purchase of lands in the boundary line between the states of Washington and Niagara is called for. The Secretary of the Senate is now endeavoring to ascertain the nature of this request and to enable your consideration to\n",

      " cause which will be necessary to effect. The amount of coin in circulation in some States, and the indications of a scarcity in others, strongly indicate the idea of the law establishing the Mint. Besides the novelty and difficulty of the instrument, many people have said, that they did not expect it to be so simple and easy. I have reason to believe, that it has been sufficiently explained to you in such a manner as toBind together the provisions of the law for the establishment of the Mint. As far as I may judge necessary to enforce the provisions of the law, it is my constant desire that the public will will subscribe to the public statement of my sentiments on the subject, and that they will not overlook the fact, that from the moment when your constitutions of government were readying themselves for the performance of their functions, foreign influence has manifested itself in the preparation of documents calculated toassuming a more independent conduct on the part of the Executive. These circumstances have induced me to pardon generally the offenders here referred to, and to extend forgiveness to those who had been adjudged to capital punishment. For though I shall always think it a sacred duty to exercise with firmness and energy the constitutional powers granted me by the Constitution, yet it appears to me no less consistent with the public good than it is with my personal feelings to mingle in the operations of Government every degree of moderation and tenderness which the national justice, dignity, and safety may permit. Gentlemen: Among the objects which will claim your attention in the course of the session, a review of our military establishment is not the least important. It is called for by the events which have changed, and may be expected still further to change, the relative situation of our frontiers. In this review you will doubtless allow due weight to the considerations that the questions between us and certain foreign powers are not yet finally adjusted, that the war in Europe is not yet terminated, and that our Western posts, when recovered, will demand provision for garrisoning and securing them. A statement of our present military force will be laid before you by the Department of War. With the review of our Army establishment is naturally connected that of the militia. It will merit inquiry what imperfections in the existing plan further experience may have unfolded. The subject is of so much moment in my estimation as to excite a constant solicitude that the consideration of it may be renewed until the greatest attainable perfection shall be accomplished. Time is wearing away some advantages for forwarding the object, while none better deserves the persevering attention of the public councils. While we indulge the satisfaction which the actual condition of our Western borders so well authorizes, it is necessary that we should not lose sight of an important truth which continually receives new confirmations, namely, that the provisions heretofore made with a view to the protection of the Indians from the violences of the lawless part of our frontier inhabitants are insufficient. It is demonstrated that these violences can now be perpetrated with impunity, and it can need no argument to prove that unless the murdering of Indians can be restrained by bringing the murderers to condign punishment, all the exertions of the Government to prevent destructive retaliations by the Indians will prove fruitless and all our present agreeable prospects illusory. The frequent destruction of innocent women and children, who are chiefly the victims of retaliation, must continue to shock humanity, and an enormous expense to drain the Treasury of the Union. To enforce upon the Indians the observance of justice it is indispensable that there shall be competent means of rendering justice to them. If these means can be devised by the wisdom of Congress, and especially if there can be added an adequate provision for supplying the necessities of the Indians on reasonable terms ( a measure the mention of which I the more readily repeat, as in all the conferences with them they urge it with solicitude ), I should not hesitate to entertain a strong hope of rendering our tranquillity permanent. I add with pleasure that the probability even of their civilization is not diminished by the experiments which have been thus far made under the auspices of Government. The accomplishment of this work, if practicable, will reflect undecaying luster on our national character and administer the most grateful consolations that virtuous minds can know. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: The state of our revenue, with the sums which have been borrowed and reimbursed pursuant to different acts of Congress, will be submitted from the proper Department, together with an estimate of the appropriations necessary to be made for the service of the ensuing year. Whether measures may not be advisable to reinforce the provision of the redemption of the public debt will naturally engage your examination. Congress have demonstrated their sense to be, and it were superfluous to repeat mine, that whatsoever will tend to accelerate the honorable extinction of our public debt accords as much with the true interest of our country as with the general sense of our constituents. Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: The statements which will be laid before you relative to the Mint will shew the situation of that institution and the necessity of some\n",

      " might be more congenial to that degree of tranquillity with which we enjoy a peaceable enjoyment of a favorable climate. Every part of our country has exhibited some marked advantages, which will be remembered, and which will be duly marked up by a consistent workgroup. The punctuality of the former in committing irregular acts of impeachment, has been exemplary. The utility of the laws in punishing offenses against the Constitution dissension among the States has been an object of rapid learning, and of military importance. It is not hard to see how, the combination of local interests, and the occasional contingency of extraordinary circumstances, may produce to considerable numbers of offenders a punishment so grossly different from that which is customary in our country. If these considerations constitute the basis of a just regard for the rights of the Indians, or of the militia, or of the natives, it will be readily conceived that their interest was not sufficiently served to guide their deliberations. The Commissioner of the United States therefore, undertook the arduous business of rendering justice to peace; seeking, at the expense of society, excesses. He sought, so as to distract public opinion from the real evils of government, and to convince those who were not involved in the real evils of foreign influence, of their right to indemnity, and of their right, under the duty of party to indemnity, to maintain order and morality. There was also a weighty and anthropomorphized object to be attended to, that the enjoyment of peace with Spain should be promoted by endeavoring to subvert this valuable source of comfort, and to inspire Europe with a desire to acquire more and more of the former. These considerations were sufficiently presented to the proper agency, which was addressed to the Senate, and they were granted, without any delay, to carry them into effect. The course of this work is, in my opinion, unavailing, if they do not correspond, with the principles, policy, or morality of our country. It must be encouraged, in every instance, to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and amity. As a rule, nations that enjoy the parenthesis of the constitution, indulge progressive and natural inclinations. In those who contradict, shallow or otherwise, the spirit of party in the government, there is inversely nurtured the misconception that there is solid political will; that there is a common will; that the common good is manifestly the most fundamental duty of our country; that the destiny of the Republican model of Government, impelled by a vindictive zeal, imbittered with a depraved sensibility, has been crowned with real and apparent advantages, and are safely standing before your eyes. The experiment, it is true, is imperfect; but it is a valuable guide, during the difficult moments, in the way of the faithful to their vows; in rendering a virtuous man virtuous, when he is not in need of it. Whether this desirable object will be the best promoted by affording each and every person under its protection the equal protection of the laws, or of the general government as a whole, I have not attended with myself, to-day. Satisfied that the experiment has been a success, I shall confine myself to my precinct in the Treasury of the United States, where, mingled with the choicest and choicest minds of Pennsylvania, it will be readily perceived that there are too many members of the legislature, too many officers, and too many considerations against striking up the conduct of government, to any decisive effect, whether enacted without restraint, or without persevering in the perils of party, languishing in wait for the next election, and looking forward to the re-election of a Republican, whose conduct will determine the permanency of the institution. I dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for my country can inspire: since there is no truth more thoroughly established, than that there exists in the oeconomy and course of nature, an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness, between duty and advantage, between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy, and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity: Since we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of Heaven, can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right; and since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty, and the destiny of the Republican model of Government, are justly considered as deeply, perhaps as finally staked, on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the people of the United States. Besides the ordinary objects submitted to your care, it will remain with your judgment to decide, how far an exercise of the occasional power delegated by the Fifth article of the Constitution is rendered expedient at the present juncture by the nature of objections which have been urged against the System, or by the degree of inquietude which has given birth to them. Instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this subject, in which I could be guided by no lights derived from official opportunities, I shall again give way to my entire\n",

      " naturally to comprehend the gravity of the moment. Our country is, in a sense, in the midst of a great civil war. In one sense this conflict is fascism; in another sense it is critical understanding that the present and future are fascist times. Already, our governments are profoundly involved. We have passed through the camps of World War II and Korea to a third world war; a fourth world war has been declared in Korea and elsewhere. Already, our soldiers and women are being physically and psychologically prepared for a second world war. We are directly involved in the defense of Korea. We have responded to the second and third world wars by a series of armed acts of aggression. In the second world war, we escalated the war in Korea into a high degree of conflict. In Korea, we have suppressed a free press that was almost completely controlled by Lee Myung-bak-Bol. In the first place, we denied the free exercise of political rights and hasfully suppressed strikes by peaceful workers and youth. In the second place, we seek more than the bare minimum of cost for aggression; more than the bare minimum of security for freedom's intransigence. We reject any insinuation that one race or another or any elite group or any race or people is in any sense inferior or expendable. 9. Respecting the United Nations as the living sign of all people's hope for peace, we shall strive to make it not merely an eloquent symbol but an effective force. And in our quest for an honorable peace, we shall neither use words nor methods nor devices nor materials nor materials perfected or hereafter determined. Nor is there much to add to the confusion. Recent statements and gestures of peace makers, however reasonable, do not necessarily imply endorsement of or support for any action or recommendations of the United Nations. Nor does their form mean that everybody should take part. 9. Respecting the United Nations as the vital link between the free world and long-term well being, we shall strive to make it a force for world peace. The United States does not seek or seek in the United Nations any reward for his part in building the world. We seek and expect from you in one place and elsewhere, the same kinds of cooperation that make up the heart of our faith in a free and sovereign nation. Your participation in the structure of the United Nations would be a support ofastonishing capacities, such as those of the Soviet Union or the French Revolution. To begin with, you have the unshakable conviction that the future of the world must be decided by your side. That belief was firmly reinforced by the courageous deeds of your Executive Branch, and by your Presidential Order No. 10,040, which issued the official diplomatic name of the Soviet Union. We immediately sent our full and primarily middle class military assistance to this task. Your midget clients and we, too, received our message because we were solicitously courteously courteously informed of their private conversations with the Soviet Union during the past three and one-half years. Recordings of our private conversations, however, have consistently demonstrated that the Soviet Union has sought and received, and will hereafter get, more than what is realistically needed for the present situation. Furthermore, the private calls and e-mails that I have, under the assumption that they will not contain the unacceptable material that has been identified, is now generally open to and may be forwarded to the Congress. I shall, however, seek in the future from you, and from the Congress if at all possible, authorization to occur at such a time. The action I propose would have to occur within the framework of the Western Hemisphere cooperation program, subject to the following conditions: 1. The countries of the Western Hemisphere cooperate to the extent permitted by common security procedures. 2. The agreement establishes, inter alia, a United Nations coordinate system of inspection and control equal to and conducive to the selection ofstanches for regional control. 3. The United States and other nations are hereby requested to join to recognize that the geographic extent of the Eastern Hemisphere does notrequire the partition of our common wealth into competing categories. The areas of the world where vast numbers ofour people are, most of whom are Foreign Service employees, are, in this sense, not terribly different from ours. 4. If there is to be a mutual aid program involving the United States and the Secondarily Developed nations,such as the Germany, Italy and Turkey aid, it is essential thatthis area should includeindium and under such equal terms as to insureequal opportunity for all employees of all nations. 5. Ifunlike other nations,the United States should seek and seekin establishing a committee to studythe relations between the United States andnonproliferation, arms control and development agencies, and toanalyse whether adequate time has been appropriated for such programs.

      " hold from us the dread task of steering our age toward a just peace. This is a moment that calls upon the governments of the world to speak their intentions with simplicity and with honesty. It calls upon them to answer the question that stirs the hearts of all sane men: is there no other way the world may live? The world knows that an era ended with the death of Joseph Stalin. The extraordinary 30-year span of his rule saw the Soviet Empire expand to reach from the Baltic Sea to the Sea of Japan, finally to dominate 800 million souls. The Soviet system shaped by Stalin and his predecessors was born of one World War. It survived with stubborn and often amazing courage a second World War. It has lived to threaten a third. Now a new leadership has assumed power in the Soviet Union. Its links to the past, however strong, can not bind it completely. Its future is, in great part, its own to make. This new leadership confronts a free world aroused, as rarely in its history, by the will to stay free. This free world knows, out of the bitter wisdom of experience, that vigilance and sacrifice are the price of liberty. It knows that the defense of Western Europe imperatively demands the unity of purpose and action made possible by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, embracing a European Defense Community. It knows that Western Germany deserves to be a free and equal partner in this community and that this, for Germany, is the only safe way to full, final unity. It knows that aggression in Korea and in southeast Asia are threats to the whole free community to be met by united action. This is the kind of free world which the new Soviet leadership confronts. It is a world that demands and expects the fullest respect of its rights and interests. It is a world that will always accord the same respect to all others. So the new Soviet leadership now has a precious opportunity to awaken, with the rest of the world, to the point of peril reached and to help turn the tide of history. Will it do this? We do not yet know. Recent statements and gestures of Soviet leaders give some evidence that they may recognize this critical moment. We welcome every honest act of peace. We care no country's right to exist in isolation but rather the well being of all others. We are willing, individually and as a Nation, to help other nations in need, to assist in finding a peace that is good for all nations. We are ready, elsewhere, to give our all to help make a better world, a world that is bright and strong. The opportunities for these all are many. The productivity of our heads, our hands and our hearts is the supreme responsibility of the free nation. We must keep it high, above all else, in life, as in business, and in government, and in religion, and in the arts, and in the arts and in a just and lasting peace. Crises there will continue to be. Progress toward these ends is desirable but necessary. We want to make certain that the peace made possible by the Oslo Accords, which were faithful to the ideals of the United Nations, does not threaten to diminish or even diminish in power any time soon. We wish our friends the world over to know this above all: we face the threat not with dread and confusion but with confidence and conviction. We feel this moral strength because we know that, as long as the world remains armed and strong, all peoples will benefit from the fullest respect of international authority. We wish all peoples to know this above all: we know that the defense of Western Europe imperatively demands the unity of purpose and action made possible by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, embracing a European Defense Community. It is made possible, in large part, by the strength of our allies, the United States, Great Britain, and France. We have joined to create and support the security system of the United Nations. We have sought, and have bellowed and will, ever after to meet the demands of the world, including obligations under the Ikedek treaty. We wish all peoples to know this above all: we face the threat not with dread and confusion but with conviction. We know that if we are not ready, perhaps we can not complete the work we are about to do, so that no disaster may come to this world. We wish all peoples to know this above all: we face the threat not with dread and confusion but with conviction. We wish all peoples to know this above all: we face the threat not with dread and confusion but with faith. This we hold as a solemn pledge to all peoples, that we will always remain ready to help build on the strength that has been done, even while danger is in the world. This we hold as a solemn pledge to all peoples, that we will never give up our faith in one another. This we hold as a solemn pledge to all peoples, that we will always strive to be of service to our brothers abroad, to help to come to a peace that is true with all peoples. This we hold as a solemn promise to\n",

      " reach. And in our quest for an honorable peace, we shall neither compromise, nor tire, nor ever cease. By these rules of conduct, we hope to be known to all peoples. By their observance, an earth of peace may become not a vision but a fact. This hope this supreme aspiration must rule the way we live. We must be ready to dare all for our country. For history does not long give way to debate, or to reflection, nor is it long enough to grow old and die. The stubborn creed of the free demands a constant source of frustration for the leaders of the Soviet Union. The rest of the world waits impatiently to see if the fearful bomb that killed four Americans in 1945 can be dropped on Britain. Or, if soigned, to see if the atomic attack on Hiroshima will be launched against Russia. Or, if soigned, to see if the Soviet Union collapses? The result will be the same. All peoples of the world will lose their homes, their economies, and their liberty. The shrill rhetoric of the Soviet Union will not stop there. It will continue to grow in the confidence and affection of the American people, the group which has united behind the United Nations. The people of the world know, already, that if the fearful trend of atomic attack can be reversed, this pattern will not be repeated. In size and variety, the United States has never before in history been so extensive. The total influence-economic, political, even spiritual will be combined to make for a single, and this, I repeat, is the only way to go on this great highway. This is the only way we can take. The world knows that an aggressor's chance of building a new American is near. The chance for building a second is near. The chance for building a third is yet to be determined. So, the United States is moving forward with a new leadership, headed by a man who has spent the last three and a half years as the acting CEO of General Motors. General Motors is now headed by Donald J. Mayhew. Now, Donald J. Mayhew is a fine man. He is a farmer. He is a firefighter. He is a farmer's son. He is a man of principle. Now, in his new role, he will not be involved in the military buildup or the direction of the U.S. government. His directorship will be vested in the military-industrial complex. The United States will protect and defend the sovereignty and independence of the nations of the area, which God willing knows not be divided over mere words and promises and gestures. And the United States will ensure that no one, no one, is in the way of this buildup or the direction of the U.N. Food and Drug Administration. This involves the world in human consumption products. We are ready, in mutual security, to produce in the United States, all the food and health products of our power to make of the world a new vision. The price of yielding this vision must be high. We are ready, in mutual security, to spend. The price of spending too much is wasted. The basic principle of comparative advantage is simplicity. What is more, the price of living in simplicity is eternal vigilance and dedication to principle. The expenditure of huge energies and energy resources on any one concern indefinitely deposits upon the well being of the peoples, the well being of the peoples. The United States will do all in our power to help to maintain this unity of purpose and effort among the free nations, so that all peoples may be successful in their quest for peace. The United Nations is ready in this work to be known and respected. We welcome any display of this unity, no matter how dimly discernible, that would be deeply destructive of the peace process. We are ready, in the unity that is the United Nations, to make of it what is of little comfort to all peoples. The reasons are not hard to find. They do not affect Russia's security, for example. Neither does it concern Russia's moral, economic, or military strength. Neither does it explain the way in which the Soviet Union collapsed. The reason is this: Because it failed to dominate, it failed to challenge, or at least make clear what had been done: a fraud on the free world. The result has been disaster for the free world, for the peace of all peoples. There persists a great temptation in the governments of Great Britain, Great France, and Germany to rake in some of these cheap salaries and benefits to gratify their own economies. So we say to our friends: We are ready, in the unity that is the the United Nations, to make of it what is of little comfort to all peoples. The reasons are not hard to find. They do not involve Russia's security, for example. Neither does it concern Russia's moral, economic, or military strength. The result has been disaster for the free world, for the peace of all peoples. There persists a great temptation in the governments of Great Britain, Great France,\n",

      " to, then it must be able to carry on for itself, and hold responsible all who profit from its operations. Our Party means to hold the heritage of American nationality unimpaired and unshaken. The world will not misconstrue. We do not mean to hold aloof. We do not mean to shun a single responsibility of this Republic to world civilization. There is no hate in the American heart. We have no envy, no suspicion, no aversion for any people in the world. We hold to our rights, and mean to defend, aye, we mean to sustain the rights of this nation and our citizens alike, everywhere under the shining sun. Yet there is the concord of amity and sympathy and fraternity in every resolution. There is a genuine aspiration in every American breast for a tranquil friendship with all the world. More we believe the unspeakable sorrows, the immeasurable sacrifices, the awakened convictions and the aspiring conscience of human kind must commit the nations of the earth to a new and better relationship. It need not be discussed now what motives plunged the world into war; it need not be inquired whether we asked the sons of this Republic to defend our national rights, as I believe we did, or to purge the old world of the accumulated ills of rivalry and greed, the sacrifices will be in vain if we can not acclaim a new order, with added security to civilization and peace maintained. One may readily sense the conscience of our America. I am sure I understand the purpose of the dominant group of the Senate. We were not seeking to defeat a world aspiration, we were resolved to safeguard America. We were resolved then, even as we are today, and will be tomorrow, to preserve this free and independent Republic. Let those now responsible, or seeking responsibility, propose the surrender, whether with interpretations, apologies or reluctant reservations—from which our rights are to be omitted, we welcome the referendum to the American people on the preservation of America, and the Republican Party pledges its defense of the preserved inheritance of national freedom. In the call of the conscience of America is peace, peace that closes the gaping wound of world war, and silences the impassioned voices of international envy and distrust. Heeding this call and knowing as I do the disposition of Congress, I promise you formal and effective peace so quickly as a Republican Congress can pass its declaration for a Republican executive to sign. Then we may turn to our readjustment at home and proceed deliberately and reflectively to that hoped for world relationship which shall satisfy both conscience and aspirations and still hold us free from menacing involvement. I can hear in the call of conscience an insistent voice for the largely reduced armaments throughout the world, with attending reduction of burdens upon peace-loving humanity. We wish to give of American influence and example; we must give of American leadership to that invaluable accomplishment. I can speak unreservedly of the American aspirations and the Republican committal for an association of nations, reentryerating in sublime accord, to attain and preserve peace through justice rather than force, determined to add to security through international law, so clarified that no misconstruction can be possible without affronting world honor. These are not unproven national aspirations, national liberation through military force, but patriotic, patriotic liberty through national rights. Under such a system the sons of this Republic will be remembered for the generations to come, and they will be royalty of the Republic. They were our eyes and ears, and ears and means to interpret the supreme commandment as we might interpret the Constitution. Ours is the temple of liberty under the law, and it is ours to call the Sons of Opportunity for the Nation to believe in. They must not only uncover the travail of unchecked enterprise, they must free the nation from the shackles of governmental operation. We must not only liberate the people, we must free the world. We do not need to sell, we do not need to serve, we do not need to profit by, but we do need to apologize for, and accept responsibility for, our own involvement in the world. I love the thought of selling and sharing the Americantan interest I hav[ides]. I have no envy to feel the blessings of business or international relationship if I sold Americantan stakes to a nation as rich and as powerful as ours. But I do like the reassurance of pride to hold that those who buy, and continue to buy, shall have no intention of buying or keeping. There is no hate in the American heart, no bitterness in our Korean or Japanese neighbors, no boastful of nationhood, but we are all America in heart and soul. Nothing in this Republican pledge of war, either political or practical, admits of American sacrifice. Commitment is about more than providing. It is about sending a powerful signal to the world that we will not begrudge the surrender of our sovereignty to any other power on earth. The world needs to be told which of us holds the new order more sacred than the institution of war.\n",

      " day and readjustment. The task is not limited to the American people. It demands a new spirit of sacrifice, a new devotion to life, a new confidence in civilization. There is something more than patriotic devotion in the patriotic citizenship. It is a movement to save America. We must restore America. We must purge the old order and restore America. I like to believe that in a new way of life America will stand for the liberties, the civil liberties, the obligations of citizenship that a people of modern-day necessity would not permit this disorder in affairs as it is. Our call is for orderly government, not inspired by superstition, and we mean to cure Disorder in America. There is no denial of normal conditions which attend America's development. Here is a problem demanding wide attention. There is no denial of normal conditions which would make usapprove of war or commit us to a course which involved excessive sacrifice. We have appraised the present state of affairs and hold ourselves perfectly still. The conditions which lead to dispersion, to dispersion- in which we commit nations, communities, and individuals to this disorder in which we have no short cut -are not new to America. They have been experiencing disordered conditions since the world began. Speaks of a great storm which destroyed civilization. Earthquakes of this description are not to be expected, no matter how highly we rejoice in the fortunate occasion. The great storm which destroyed civilization was attended by many failures and misfortunes. But we are not to think of Earthquake after Earthquake, except in the most deplorable terms. These were the failures of the first order, the failures of reaction which is the propertied act of creation. The greatest heroism has been found in the commons which are truly our inalienable rights, and we ought to hold the highest regard for them. Yet there is the concord of amity and sympathy and fraternity in the commons which marked humanity itself in conflict. We must not forget that concord of birth, that concord of sacrifice, that concord of living, that concord of sympathy and fraternity which marked humanity apart from the world, made us what we are. We have no use bidding humanity unite, in lamentable sacrifices, in dying. We have only wrought through eloquence, through inspiration, through the love of country, through the immortal law of the Republic. There is a voice for them in the concord of life, who have made the sublime offering and risen to higher achievement. There is a voice for them in the concord of death, who have torn the vestiges of civilization from our own people and torn it from the world. Let us return for a moment to the necessity for understanding, and then we may turn to the unity of our Constitution, our hope for an America of peace, and our devotion to country which must be. No one word of disinterestedness or partiality may be directed in this urgent call to action. On the one hand we wish to establish a tranquil America, without afront of armed conflict, on the stable, stable foundation of justice and civilization. On the other hand we may utter the faith and aspirations, and share their hopeful aspirations, and make them heard among fellow human beings. We hold to our rights, and mean to defend, aye, we mean to sustain the rights of this nation and our citizens alike, when battle and conquest are the penalties of the moral malaise which blighted youth and townsfolk alike. We wish to hold fast to the preserved rights of people and estates, and preserve the distinction between rich and poor, class and luxury, before the storm of civil war and of revolution. There is yet unreserved approximately 200,000,000 acres in the public domain, 20,000,000 acres of which are known to be susceptible of reclamation and made fit for homes by provision of irrigation. The Government has been assisting in the development of its remaining lands, until the unfortunate drought of the past twenty years has rendered them largely unoccupied. The Government has been assisting in the development of its remaining lands, until the unfortunate drought of the past year. America would look with anxiety on the development of such a valuable and productive section as is today recognized to be unacceptably rugged, and would have little desire to associate with nations which drift amiss in the direction of excessive, though not impossible, war. While these are serious problems, the Nation has been providing and administering for them, and the cost of providing and administering for reconstruction and defense is accentuated. Cost of military defense includes no excess of money expended, but we feel the necessity of developing and widening our military industrial base, so that we may afford the highest possible credit facilities and the highest credit facilities are maintained. Every facility is bestowed with due attention to detail and the deliberate appraisal of the case in mind.

      ", but I must admit that there is something inherently wrong in discouraging trade with nations which are either committing destruction to the earth or turning the seasick. It is not to be argued that we can solve the problem of indifferent rates without infringing on the freedom of labor who are called to labor by the Government. The demand for work is not so much a demand for labor, but a demand for service, which is precisely the thing which the law must prohibit. The demand for service, in the main, is not so much a demand for rate fixing, as it is a demand for service on one hand, to make certain that the rates which are charged are not contrary to vast sections of the people and are not unreasonably high. It is not to be challenged that the Constitution contemplates much of this question, and requires some proof of conferment on the part of the Republic, to be proved beyond doubt. The law which makes provision for the denial of dating or the denial of rates to nations is directed against the fours, and requires that proof of which is No. 100 on the reviewer's examination of American laws is proof enough to speed the denial of denial of this proof. Reliance is due to be had on the American construction on the one hand, and the substitution of a Chief Executive by of Warrant, on the other. The fact that labor is required to make the greatest contribution to the construction of a modern transportation system, wherever that department is concerned, is proof enough to make the proof President Reagan made on the issue of war funding. The provision is not less essential when it concerns rates of interest on the one hand, and it is better to deal with the pressing problems on the other. The suggestion is worthy of consideration, but the call is not in the ears of the nation to go far afield from war-stricken nations. It is better to remain close to home, preserve ideals of opportunity and opportunity- and, frankly, to all that is humanly possible. There is no greater peril. The Constitution contemplates no class and recognizes no group. It broadly includes all the people, with specific recognition for none, and the highest consecration we can make today is a committal of the Republican Party to that saving constitutionalism which contemplates all America as one people, and holds just government free from influence on the one hand and unmoved by intimidation on the other. It would be the blindness of folly to ignore the activities in our own country which are aimed to destroy our economic system, and to commit us to the colossal tragedy which has both destroyed all freedom and made Russia impotent. This movement is not to be halted in throttled liberties. We must not abridge the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, or the freedom of assembly, because there is no promise in repression. These liberties are as sacred as the freedom of religious belief, as inviolable as the rights of life and the pursuit of happiness. We do hold to the right to crush sedition, to stifle a menacing contempt for law, to stamp out a peril to the safety of the Republic or its people, when emergency calls, because security and the majesty of the law are the first essentials of liberty. He who threatens destruction of the Government by force or flaunts his contempt for lawful authority, ceases to be a loyal citizen and forfeits his rights to the freedom of the Republic. Let it be said to all of America that our plan of popular government contemplates such orderly changes as the crystallized intelligence of the majority of our people think best. There can be no modification of this underlying rule, but no majority shall abridge the rights of a minority. Men have a right to question our system in fullest freedom, but they must always remember that the rights of freedom impose the obligations which maintain it. Our policy is not of repression, but we make appeal today to American intelligence and patriotism, when the Republic is menaced from within, just as we trusted American patriotism when our rights were threatened from without. We call on all America for steadiness, so that we may proceed deliberately with the readjustment which concerns all the people. Our party platform fairly expresses the conscience of Republicans on industrial relations. No party is indifferent to the welfare of the wage-earner. To us his good fortune is of deepest concern, and we seek to make that good fortune permanent. We do not oppose but approve collective bargaining, because that is an outstanding right, but we are unalterably insistent that its exercise must not destroy the equally sacred right of the individual, in his necessary pursuit of livelihood. Any American has the right to quit his employment, so has every American the right to seek employment. The group must not endanger the individual, and we must discourage groups preying upon one another, and none shall be allowed to forget that government's obligations are alike to all the people. I hope we may do more than merely discourage the losses and sufferings attending industrial conflict. The strike against the\n",

      ", I view it as an extreme measure, to be resorted to only in extraordinary cases, as where it may become necessary to defend the executive against the encroachments of the legislative power or to prevent hasty and inconsiderate or unconstitutional legislation. By cautiously confining this remedy within the sphere prescribed to it in the contemporaneous expositions of the framers of the Constitution, the will of the people, legitimately expressed on all subjects of legislation through their constitutional organs, the Senators and Representatives of the United States, will have its full effect. As indispensable to the preservation of our system of self government, the independence of the representatives of the States and the people is guaranteed by the Constitution, and they owe no responsibility to any human power but their constituents. By holding the representative responsible only to the people, and exempting him from all other influences, we elevate the character of the constituent and quicken his sense of responsibility to his country. It is under these circumstances only that the elector can feel that in the choice of the lawmaker he is himself truly a component part of the sovereign power of the nation. With equal care we should study to defend the rights of the executive and judicial departments. Our Government can only be preserved in its purity by the suppression and entire elimination of every claim or tendency of one coordinate branch to encroachment upon another. With the strict observance of this rule and the other injunctions of the Constitution, with a sedulous inculcation of that respect and love for the Union of the States which our fathers cherished and enjoined upon their children, and with the aid of that overruling Providence which has so long and so kindly guarded our liberties and institutions, we may reasonably expect to transmit them, with their innumerable blessings, to the remotest posterity. But attachment to the Union of the States should be habitually fostered in every American heart. For more than half a century, during which kingdoms and empires have fallen, this Union has stood unshaken. The patriots who formed it have long since descended to the grave; yet still it remains, the proudest monument to their memory and the object of affection and admiration with everyone worthy to bear the American name. In my judgment its dissolution would be the greatest of calamities, and to avert that should be the study of every American. Upon its preservation must depend our own happiness and that of countless generations to come. Whatever dangers may threaten it, I shall stand by it and maintain it in its integrity to the full extent of the obligations imposed and the powers conferred upon me by the Constitution To the Senate of the United States: I transmit to the Senate, in answer to a resolution of that body passed on the 17th instant, the accompanying reports of heads of Departments which contain all the official information in the possession of the Executive asked for by the resolution. On coming into office I found the military commandant of the Department of California exercising the functions of civil governor in that Territory, and left, as I was, to act under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, without the aid of any legislative provision establishing a government in that Territory, I thought it best not to disturb that arrangement, made under my predecessor, until Congress should take some action on that subject. I therefore did not interfere with the powers of the military commandant, who continued to exercise the functions of civil governor as before; but I made no such appointment, conferred no such authority, and have allowed no increased compensation to the commandant for his services. With a view to the faithful execution of the treaty so far as lay in the power of the Executive, and to enable Congress to act at the present session with as full knowledge and as little difficulty as possible on all matters of interest in these Territories, I sent the Hon. Thomas Butler King as bearer of dispatches to California, and certain officers to California and New Mexico, whose duties are particularly defined in the accompanying letters of instruction addressed to them severally by the proper Departments. I did not hesitate to express to the people of those Territories my desire that each Territory should, if prepared to comply with the requisitions of the Constitution of the United States, form a plan of a State constitution and submit the same to Congress with a prayer for admission into the Union as a State, but I did not anticipate, suggest, or authorize the establishment of any such government without the assent of Congress, nor did I authorize any Government agent or officer to interfere with or exercise any influence or control over the election of delegates or over any convention in making or modifying their domestic institutions or any of the provisions of their proposed constitution. On the contrary, the instructions given by my orders were that all measures of domestic policy adopted by the people of California must originate solely with themselves; that while the Executive of the United States was desirous to protect them in the formation of any government republican in its character, to be at the proper time submitted to Congress, yet it was to be distinctly understood that the plan of such a government must at the same time be the result of their own deliberate choice\n",

      " Central States. The early declarations of the Executive of the United States, in the performance of their respective duties, have produced results fully showing that the partial attainment of these ends will require the complete suppression of every expression of sentiment and patriotism within the next Administration. The course adopted in dipping the spear in the controversy which may result from the adoption of this policy and the policy of my predecessor in suppressing it, the first strike on the New Mexico Railroad, by the citizens of New Mexico and New Mexico, and the act of Congress extending that same protection to California, Oregon, and Washington, make it certain that similar suffering will result from the practice of the Government in this respect rendered so honorable, and justify the suppression of that branch of the public service I refer to in my annual message of awaiting the salutary operation of those causes, believing that we shall thus avoid the creation of geographical parties and secure the harmony of feeling so necessary to the beneficial action of our political system. Connected, as the Union is, with the remembrance of past happiness, the sense of present blessings, and the hope of future peace and prosperity, every dictate of wisdom, every feeling of duty, and every emotion of patriotism tend to inspire fidelity and devotion to it and admonish us cautiously to avoid any unnecessary controversy which can either endanger it or impair its strength, the chief element of which is to be found in the regard and affection of the people for each other To the Senate of the United States: I herewith transmit to the Senate, for their advice with regard to its ratification, a convention between the United States and Great Britain, concluded at Washington on the 19th instant by John M. Clayton, Secretary of State, on the part of the United States, and by the Right Hon. Sir Henry Lytton Bulwer, on the part of Great Britain. This treaty has been negotiated in accordance with the general views expressed in my message to Congress in December last. Its object is to establish a commercial alliance with all great maritime states for the protection of a contemplated ship canal through the territory of Nicaragua to connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and at the same time to insure the same protection to the contemplated railways or canals by the Tehuantepec and Panama routes, as well as to every other interoceanic communication which may be adopted to shorten the transit to or from our territories on the Pacific. It will be seen that this treaty does not propose to take money from the public Treasury to effect any object contemplated by it. It yields to the power of Congress the right of taking all necessary measures to open the canal, but it also diminishes the right of the National Treasury to make all such domestic expenditures, subject only to the strict observance of the law of the United States. It also enshrine into the Constitution the wishes of the framers of the Constitution, the powers of the Executive and the Administration of this Government, which are strongly connected with the duties of the office of public minister. The position of the Sandwich Islands with reference to the territory of the United States on the Pacific, the success of our persevering and benevolent citizens who have repaired to that remote quarter in Christianizing the natives and inducing them to adopt a system of government and laws suited to their capacity and wants, and the use made by our numerous whale ships of the harbors of the islands as places of resort for obtaining refreshments and repairs all combine to render their destiny peculiarly interesting to us. It is our duty to encourage the authorities of those islands in their efforts to improve and elevate the moral and political condition of the inhabitants, and we should make reasonable allowances for the difficulties inseparable from this task. We desire that the islands may maintain their independence and that other nations should concur with us in this sentiment. We could in no event be indifferent to their passing under the dominion of any other power. The receipts into the Treasury for the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June last were, in cash, $ 48,830,097.50, and in Treasury notes funded $ 10,833,000, making an aggregate of $ 59,663,097.50; and the expenditures for the same time were, in cash, $ 46,798,667.82, and in Treasury notes funded $ 10,833,000, making an aggregate of $ 57,631,667.82. The accounts and estimates which will be submitted to Congress in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury show that there will probably be a deficit occasioned by the expenses of the Mexican War and treaty on the 1st day of July next of $ 5,828,121.66, and on the 1st day of July, 1851, of $ 10,547,092.73, making in the whole a probable deficit to be provided for of $ 16,375,214.39. The extraordinary expenses of the war with Mexico and the purchase of California and New Mexico exceed in amount this deficit, together with the loans heretofore made for those objects. I therefore recommend that authority\n",

      "[900 | 223.19] loss=0.02 avg=0.02\n",
      "======== SAMPLE 1 ========\n",
      ", although not as large as they seem, yet are they sufficient to satisfy the purpose. I therefore recommend that authority be given to borrow what ever sum may be necessary to cover the deficit occasioned by the expenses of the service of the common nation. I recommend such a reduction. Should Congress prefer to abolish the franking privilege entirely, it seems probable that no demand on the Treasury would result from the proposed reduction of postage. Whether any further diminution should now be made, or the result of the reduction to 5 cents, which I have recommended, should be first tested, is submitted to your decision. Since the commencement of the last session of Congress a postal treaty with Great Britain has been received and ratified, and such relations have been formed by the post-office departments of the two countries in pursuance of that treaty as to carry its provisions into full operation. The attempt to extend this same arrangement through England to France has not been equally successful, but the purpose has not been abandoned. For a particular statement of the condition of the Post-Office Department and other matters connected with that branch of the public service I refer you to the report of the Postmaster-General. By the act of the 3d of March, 1849, a board was constituted to make arrangements for taking the Seventh Census, composed of the Secretary of State, the Attorney-General, and the Postmaster-General; and it was made the duty of this board “to prepare and cause to be printed such forms and schedules as might be necessary for the full enumeration of the inhabitants of the United States, and also proper forms and schedules for collecting in statistical tables, under proper heads, such information as to mines, agriculture, commerce, manufactures, education, and other topics as would exhibit a full view of the pursuits, industry, education, and resources of the country.” The duties enjoined upon the census board thus established having been performed, it now rests with Congress to enact a law for carrying into effect the provision of the Constitution which requires an actual enumeration of the people of the United States within the ensuing year. Among the duties assigned by the Constitution to the General Government is one of local and limited application, but not on that account the less obligatory. I allude to the trust committed to Congress as the exclusive legislator and sole guardian of the interests of the District of Columbia. I beg to commend these interests to your kind attention. As the national metropolis the city of Washington must be an object of general interest; and founded, as it was, under the auspices of him whose immortal name it bears, its claims to the fostering care of Congress present themselves with additional strength. Whatever can contribute to its prosperity must enlist the feelings of its constitutional guardians and command their favorable consideration. Our Government is one of limited powers, and its successful administration eminently depends on the confinement of each of its coordinate branches within its own appropriate sphere. The first section of the Constitution ordains that All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives. The Executive has authority to recommend ( not to dictate ) measures to Congress. Having performed that duty, the executive department of the Government can not rightfully control the decision of Congress on any subject of legislation until that decision shall have been officially submitted to the President for approval. The check provided by the Constitution in the clause conferring the qualified veto will never be exercised by me except in the cases contemplated by the fathers of the Republic. I view it as an extreme measure, to be resorted to only in extraordinary cases, as where it may become necessary to defend the executive against the encroachments of the legislative power or to prevent hasty and inconsiderate or unconstitutional legislation. By cautiously confining this remedy within the sphere prescribed to it in the contemporaneous expositions of the framers of the Constitution, the will of the people, legitimately expressed on all subjects of legislation through their constitutional organs, the Senators and Representatives of the United States, will have its full effect.

      " danger, which are yet in a process of gradualance, but which the present condition of the species of wildlife which may inhabit such a settlement may deserve the serious consideration of Congress. While the species which have already been extensively studied at the national parks and other establishments of interesting value to our national interests are more than ready to be exhibited to the world, so far as the object accomplished is concerned, it will be only by the scientific, experimental, and preparatory work of the institution itself may the ultimate determination of the interest be made by legislative acts, forms, and instructions, as to the ultimate location of the species, be realized. The commissioners appointed, conformably to the act of 1826 - 05 - 20, to look after the public lands, and to provide for the preservation of them, have been now together together for more than two years. They have recently been together for a long time. The report from the Secretary of the Interior, with copies to the children of the land, is now on the first page. It will be seen that it is a body of timber men, barefoot and wearing horse to the work, and that it is authorized in the act of 1827 - 03 - 02, to carry into execution the provisions of the act of 1827 - 03 - 02, for the preservation of the public lands across the Missouri River. The report from the Under Secretary of War for Roads and Canals is now in the process of transmission. It will be seen that it is a body of troops, clad in allusion to the duties of a warrior-patriot, and that it is authorized in the act of 1827 - 03 - 02, to carry into execution the provisions of the act of 1827 - 03 - 02, for the preservation of the public lands across the Mississippi River. The report of the Secretary of War and the documents with the county and municipal authorities of the State of Georgia exhibit the same views. In the recent proclamation of the governor of that State by thewright James A. Proctor and Subcommander of the Army that same last Monday a body of about twenty men having a general purpose in the service of the State returned to their assigned place of work, and embarked upon a continual display of their authority and of their usefulness in the eyes of the men who issued the proclamation. The report from the governor of the State of Georgia exhibits the same experience with which the United States have been used as reference points in the transactions of the international scene. The presence at Panama, the first meeting of the congress at Mexico, and the first meeting of the General Assembly at Mexico have been marked by the regularities of themie inquiries and interpositions, the more so when the occasion was to receive information from a foreign government. Here, in the American hemisphere, as in the Mediterranean, the functions of the United States have been to recommend itself to the interests of the other members of the conference to the advantage of the other American states, to receive instruction from them, to prepare and explain to the other nations accordingly, have been compositions rather of the spirit of multitudes upon earth, and have been in part results of the practice and obligation of the United States in taking those actions which, as being within the constitutional competency of the executive, they were directed to undertake. The statements of the officers who have so far occupied the action of the United States under their charge have been: That Great Britain will not grant to the United States any measure of reciprocity in the relation of our naval force to that of the other great powers; That the United States will not accept of orders from any naval officer of the most powerful nation upon the globe, and That all arrangements for the defense of our waters, harbours, and buoys should be made for the protection of the American people, in the event of a failure of the British orders to fulfill their obligations under the convention; that the United States will continue to be considered a power, not of members of the sea, but of a continental land, dominantly covered with sea and land, of four seas a day, adapted to the wants and distress of the people of this continent. Such things have been accomplished in execution on three continents, and will continue so far as they are in the future engagements. The conventions of 1815 - 07 - 03, and of 1818 - 10 - 20, will expire by their own limitation on 1828 - 10 - 20. These have regulated the direct commercial intercourse between the United States and Great Britain upon terms of the most perfect reciprocity; and they effected a temporary compromise of the respective rights and claims to territory westward of the Rocky Mountains. These arrangements have been continued for an indefinite period of time after the expiration of the above mentioned conventions, leaving each party the liberty of terminating them by giving twelve months ' notice to the other. The radical principle of all commercial intercourse between independent nations is the mutual interest of both parties. It is the living armory of their government. It is the bulwark of their civilization. It has the surest pledge of a permanent security,\n",

On completing the survey of Charlestown, Virginia, a ship of the Maryland and Virginia Canal Company was dispatched by Baltimore, Maryland, to commence the survey. A report from the Captain of the Maryland and Virginia Department of Governmental Affairs, herewith communicated. A report from the Secretary of State and the Postmaster General, herewith communicated. Two other similar surveys of the same shore have been commenced, but with unsatisfied results. The third survey has succeeded in presenting to Washington D. C. the surveyors, surveyors, and engineers of the Engineers upon Measures for Combining the Dismalming of the Norfolk River. The surveyors have been retained, and no decision has yet been taken as to the expediency of connecting the workmen of the neighboring cities of London and New Haven. To reduce the burden of this trying and expensive work, when experience has proved that a good deal of variation in the light of moral and economical circumstances has been necessary in conformity with the act of Congress of 1827 - 03 - 01, to connect the work of the sea. It is with a satisfaction bordering upon imbecility that we have found the only relief we can offer is to substitute different means of bringing the object of our deepest interest to a sudden and desperate conflict. The instance of this emergency having been occasioned by a sudden and desperate demand for support from the Indian tribes, it has been merely by sheltering themselves under the banners of some of the most dangerous men on earth. The authorities of this and subsequent lands have always been hostile, and herewith a new impulse has been added to the policy of our Union. Propositions of hostility from foreign nations, hitherto unsuspected, have been foreseen since the history of man was a series of ages ago. It is this which gives inestimable value to the character of our Government, at once federal and national. It holds out to us a perpetual admonition to preserve alike and with equal anxiety the rights of these Other Tribes wherever you are, and to preserve alike and with equal anxiety the rights of your own people and theirs. That fearless national spirit which declares to the wholehedge of God, to the school of war, to the school of peace, and the school of religious liberty, declares with delight to all nations that peace without war is a lasting trust in its blessings and that every nation must by its own freedom be secured from all further invasion. Security, moreover, is our pledge. If the enemy of our brethren in the earth shall attempt to take our land, and our sacred groves, and our refounting vessels, and our skies, and our agriculture, and our agriculture's produce, and our civilization, and our civilization's progress and our progress's behalf shall be shaken. It is a pledge from the father of all Christianity that we will faithfully guard the source of all goodness and preserve the source of the universe for the benefit of all. Peace and Worship of the Senate. By the authority of his act of 1827 - 03 - 01, upon the adjustment of the debt of 1813 - 09 - 25 to $ 17,000,000, it was directed that if the Senate should deliberate and act upon modifying the debt, it should be immediately accomplished, and that it should be recast as a blessing from the hands of which it is really no threat, and that in three years from 1813 - 09 - 25 to 1827 - 03 - 01, the debt would be unadjusted. That act, however, was not executed until after the expiration of the present month, so as not to affect the intent of the act itself. The Senate, therefore, by the resolution of 1827 - 03 - 01, recommended and agreed upon a plan for carrying into effect the provisions of the act of 1813 - 03 - 01, and the supplemental act of 1813 - 03 - 09, reducing the debt of 1813 - 03 - 01 to $ 6,000,000. This plan, first proclaimed to the world in a new and unequivocal voice, and which has been steadily receiving the approbation of our country's senators, is yet more valuable to the Republics of Europe and to the world as the instrument by which free Liberty can be secured. While so many of our fellow citizens have been enabled to slip under the burden of this free enterprise, at the same time a new boon of discovery has been bestowed upon the country that richly rewards its independence. Inward Spain has been extended to her colonies in America, and her colonies in Europe know more about us than any of her neighbors have known when we first assembled for an interdiction of production. We have been formed, in the first meeting of our Congress, to estimate the receipts and expenditures of the ensuing year according to theible objects of discovery, and to estimate their relative importance. The first of these sums is due to the expedition of the United States to the West Indies,\n",

      " specialities are to be found in the civil laws relating to the same, and the laws of one or more of the United States relating to the same. The duties of the United States in all cases must be proportional and be paid in proportion to the services which the offender intends to inflict upon his fellow citizens. so far as the purpose of the act requires it the offender is guilty of two crimes, one of violence and murder. The second degree, operating in the common element, is always assigned to the action of the military force. It will be seen that the moral character of the force is susceptible of much improvement from the operation of this policy, and that the moral aspect of the policy will in some degree depend upon the number and extent of the objects of moral improvement to which it is devoted. The moral character of the military force will in some degree be adapted to the object of waging war, and its effects will be adapted to the specific wants of a specific community. The experiments which the military force can do often exceed the budgets of the States, and often fail utterly to deliver. It were, indeed, a vain and dangerous illusion to believe that in the present or probable condition of human society a competent arm could be had them; but in theINEACH there has been scarcely been a period in human history in which a federal department has been acting in a manner so extensively adapted to the benefit of its members, and in such a manner as to substitute for the usual channels the office of mediator of the parties, and the interposition of the other powers Court of Claims. The first of these, the intentional retaliatory colonelship, is a mode of living coextensive with human rights of the people of this Union which has continued unabated for the ages to come. The second, the retaliatory exemption, is a special privilege enjoyed by the enumerated numbers of the American Union Presidents, who during the two centuries during which the privilege has been enjoyed have been citizens of the Union and of the world. They have continued to be enjoyed, their blood streams have been interwoven with that of their brethren from all nations, and their talents have been impelled into the practice of European nations. The United States of America and the people of every state of which they are enumerated are the representatives of that nation throughout the globe. They constitute the very portion of our country which has been and is now divided into two classes, the owning and the ruled. The owning portion are the tenants of the public lands, and the reigning portion are the tenants of the purchasers. The law of property is the exclusive instrument for taking them from the owning portion, and the retaliatory legislation, the forbearance to take them from the unprovoked, amnesty for them only if And thus the general outline of the legislation of the United States for the suppression of the African slave trade, under the auspices and at the expense of the United States, has been enacted. The legislation for the transportation of the slaves has been the act of Congress of 1824 - 01 07. The act of 1825 03 - 03, authorizing the Secretary of War to convey slaves to the destination of the alleged violation, and for the transportation of the imposts and the like article, has been executed by the transportation of more than 1,500 miles from that location. The report from the Postmaster General, with copies to the people and foreign governments of the two countries where the trade was carried on, is now in the possession of the board of engineers. The addition of a second, and perhaps a third, article of the same construction, will probably retain the force of the law, and will leave in the state of the country more or less the same object at the commencement of the new century. The present state of the Army and the distribution of the force of which it is composed will be seen from the report of the Secretary of War. They comprise a force of nearly 3,000 officers, all of them of African appearance, and all of them armed with six or seven different firearms. They have been exhibited to the attention of the Legislature, and they will be so exhibited to the mind of the people of this Union that I can not but hope that they will convince them of the necessity of a return to the old, heavy, and often oppressive system of colonial monopoly, of excluding the vessels of vanquished countries from the trade of the United States, and of holding them at bay with banners and muskets and other military objects of peace and valor. Amidst the multiplicity of topics of great national concernment which may recommend themselves to the calm and patriotic deliberations of the Legislature, it may suffice to say that on these and all other measures which may receive their sanction my hearty cooperation will be given, conformably to the duties enjoined upon me and against unreasonable GBTEs, and the grateful acknowledgment of 700 other deserving sufferers of TBTEI, THAFARI, CAPITOL, LUXEMBOUGHT, ORTHODOX, ORTHOPA, CAPITAL, CAPITL\n",

      " restrictions on nonindebtedness. Further, we must take measures designed to minimize the financial dependence of the new economy on foreign oil. Financed reform requires major economic changes and a major change in our economic structure. And my generation and I have a new obligation to the American people. We must engage the working people of the United States in uniting behind a common cause, a common cause that remembers the lives of millions of Americans who were threatened by outside forces. That is our mission. And to the American people, I promise this: This effort is not new. It was first proposed by former President Jimmy Carter. And it has been endorsed by congressional leaders. It has been tested, and it has implemented. This new approach is sound and has been endorsed by Democratic leaders. It is timeless. And it is working. Many small business people are choosing to stay open. Many Americans are choosing to work with us. And in terms of jobs, be: ( 1 doing what I have to be: ( A. Good. And in terms of who I serve, be: ( 1 a woman, I'll do what is necessary to serve and to maintain my passion for public service. So, in terms of philosophy, be: ( 1 a liberal, true to his word, I think we could do better as a nation. I think we could do better as a people. This isn't some intellectual would furlough political opponents, some world-class scientist, for God's sake say what with all the cronies out there. Who the furlough people are. I just don't think we are. And my friends, we've got to change. And I believe we've got to change, because the old ways are going to be dissolved. And there's a woman in Washington called Christina Blackwell. And she says democracy is working. You remember, when we were melting down, the tears of the young people fallen for a dictator's game, the old PBS documentary When a President Wants To be President. [ Laughter ] And my top adviser, the President, said this: You see, the problems we are trying to address have roots in fathers leaving the home, grandparents not living with their parents in one place, and corporations going overseas and creating jobs there. We are trying to solve those problems. And I say if they are going to be sold, we need to make America great again. Well, let's build on our strengths. My plan is simple and steady: we increase the standard of living for every American. The key to it is this: By 1993, we are closer to 300 million people making less than they are now, earning just $ 2,000 a year. Then we'll get to 400 million people making just $ 2,500,000. And then we'll get to 500 million people making just $ 3,000,000. And then, finally, we'll get to 1.6 billion people making just $ 4,000,000. And so, spread across all income levels, our strength is cumulative. It's cumulative, in many cases, because of the strength of our families, because of the strength of our schools, because of the strength of our communities. Our children are watching in schools across this country whose future we can not control. And we're watching. And they're right to be. The world is watching. And we are watching. And we are watching. And we are watching. And they can choose from one set of economic, social, or military programs. From public school through college, children can go to school, and then they can go to church, and then they can go to worship. And then they can stop and think about their families. and friends. And many of them will be growing up to be the leaders of their families. And I just think it's time for a change. And we really have to want to do everything we can to ensure that every American has the freedom and the security of a home. We don't have that luxury anymore. And I have asked the Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Jim Cole, to join me in calling for a major reform of the current system. This reform could lead to better jobs and better lives for American workers. It could even lead to the privatization of our industries. But these are the first steps, real steps, toward a future where the future of America is in our hands. It's time to put the federal government out of our business, out of our educational, and out of our health care. We've got to start with the family. Let's make it a health care issue. And for the infants and kids, stay. Give them the best care possible. Help them lose weight. And more specifically, lose the fight. Fight to preserve our national security. Lose one another's culture. Lose one another's traditions. Lose one another be: ( 1 fighting to reduce smoking, increase democracy, increase economic opportunity.

      " Europe for this very reason. We have already expressed our position very clearly in the international round of elections. Let us continue our negotiations with the Soviet Union, without prejudice to the outcome of the election, to ensure that the strength of this relationship does not diminish. The fact that this does not conflict with the international law is one of the few things that does. Yes, our participation in the elections made a profound impression on the whole community of democratic nations. And therefore, we, the Federation of European States, Federation of Seven, and other countries, have, and have always believed in the necessity of participation in these elections. We took this position because: 1. The national leaders did not want us to participate, and, 2. The national leaders wanted us to remain passive, and, 3. The national leaders wanted us to remain objective, in light of events at home. Those are the things that have happened in Europe in the past year. And what we did, today we have to face them. If we continue to participate indifferently in these elections, and whether in a good or a bad way, we will have to say a great deal about ourselves. And I can say this: This is not political love, and I don't love it. We made a choice: Either we or they made a terrible choice, and we made a terrible choice. Either way, we made a terrible choice. And if we don't change, we will be forever changed. And that's what this election is all about. And I look forward to what we have to meet in November., And I look forward to what we will eventually face. And I look forward to what kind of nation we will have., And the stars align For many years, America and its allies have stood shoulder to shoulder against enemies on the battlefield. And today, in this historic vote, we must join together these unfree territories, and we must work for a new Europe that remembers America and values Europe no more. We must look beyond the immediate aftermath of an invasion or a crisis, taking actions that will help protect and expand our cherished European project. And we must be flexible, tolerant, and optimistic, taking what works and what doesn't. We must continue to build on our historic partnership, coexisting on the basis of a common vision of the future. In this election, you'll hear the candidates tell the truth, but every one of us knows that America is stronger together in this new world order than any single nation, nation-state system that has yet to emerge. This election is about choice, and America has never hesitated to make the choice between two men who have longed for greatness and who have searched for it. And today, in an historic election, the destiny of America itself is in her hands. We see today why democracy can win this war. And we see why our nation will never win it alone. But we also know that only by overcoming racial divisions, anti-Semitism, and hate can we win this great struggle for freedom. And we know that only by winning now will America allow herself to be destroyed. Because of her, as well as because of her integrity, is her future. For her, the United States can be called what it is and what it should be - a leader in the world community, a master of world affairs, a true leader of Eastern Europe. A true leader of Europe, yes. And a true European, one who has served as President of the United Nations, one who has compassion for ordinary people, one who has a heart of gold for this continent. This is a nation whose history, culture, and people have longed for this very future. This is a nation who began its struggle for independence with a promise of promise, but a new reality has dawned: America does not need the United States today. America does not need to be called what it was a moment ago. America is no longer enough to stand for greatness or to speak of it now. We need to recognize that what makes us unique is our tolerance and our commitment to diversity. America is not just a people - not even close - to this diversity. We are Americans to all sides. And across the board, everywhere we look, people of every race, colors, creeds, and creeds have a special place in our hearts for us. We are like a beautiful bouquet, like a dream come true. But more importantly, what we have become - a people - is a shining example of goodness. A nation that stands for hope, for freedom, and for the world. A nation that stands for unity, not just a idea; not just a thousand points of light - but the whole, absolute, being of every American. Every American adult, senator, Congressman, and audience member will know this promise is a powerful one. We are the shining example of America. Thank you. God bless you, and good night. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, thank you all. Thank you all very, very much. Thank you all very, very much.\n",

      " add to them in return. For we are given these words: “Use power only to use it wisely.” To those nations, let us hope you'll agree that power should be limited in reward and in time. But even more, let us hope you'll accept our shared responsibility for the consequences of our early involvement in the Gulf. Once we're sure that Saddam Hussein will not gain the upper hand, we will move forward with all the necessary sanctions which we have until the operation is fully explained and under way in regime change. As our forces fight, we ask you to bear in mind that humanitarian catastrophes, including the fall of a friendly country, are not the fault of its neighbors; rather, they are the result of regimes change since our side intervened. Now, more than ever, it is the sovereign individual right to do as we have to achieve our better interests. We will not fail. Proud parents, happy families, strong families, Iowa—we're asking you to do just what you can. You must learn from those who said, “Use power only to use it wisely.” For those Presidents who have said it better than many others, let us say that under his leadership the United States has cut oil imports 40 percent and cut spending while saving $ 30 billion. Let us also not forget that, when the United States negotiated the Gulf peace, no other nation stepped forward. A President who spoke out against the war, regrets did so. But in his veto-wielding, forlorn hope was lost amidst ruins when Saddam Hussein razed his own country in January, Kuwait. No one should have to tell the world, but tragically, 93 year old Mr. Hussein is Saddam Hussein. I have said it was my hope that his ruthless policy might be stopped. And I do not exaggerate. I struck up a friendship with him. He was never involved in drug dealing. I had the good sense to continue my training and I went to war with Iraq in the early morning hours of January January, 5 days after I took off from Moscow for Saudi Arabia. There was no question about that. We acted as if the world was a different place. We peaceably conducted an unprecedented war. We have kept this war out of the hands of the West, and we have kept it from the very hands that seek to shape our political, economic, and military policies. The fact that we did not go to war with Iraq is a fact of life in this war, a fact of life for the United States and the world for 27 years. Since the start of this war, we have never intimidated an adversary. We have no bravado. We have no moral compass. We have no integrity. We defeated a tyrant. What more can we need? President Bush. I just thought, you remember that old line from The Maltese Falcon, when the tyrant says, “Palatable, contraband, perversion of the mind.” I would like to ask the United States Senators to take this opportunity to humorly or to boast about it. They don't talk about it that way. They don't engage in it that way. They pay no attention to the dollars. They spend no one dime. There is no blame to be had. What is done and what is being done should be done, and those who have been elected to such posts should be brought to justice. I have called for a an investigation by the United Nations Commission on Iraq War Crimes. I have proposed that the United States designate military commanders to take punitive action against Iraq. I have proposed that docking the Iraqi rulers with criminals must be a red line of international law. And I have asked for congressional action. And I've asked for your support for legislation to provide more than 60 days for the Iraqi Government to comply with all the requirements of the agreement on the phasedin withdrawal. If you believe that this unilateralism mandates war, send me a check for between $ 20 and $ 30 billion. And most of all, I ask you to convey the urgency of your demands to the President immediately. I understand that you have been out of town for a few days because of work, and we could be talking in London on Monday evening or Tuesday evening about matters of international politics. But in the interest of national unity, I ask you to convey the urgency of your concern to the Russian Government. We could be headed for a catastrophic war. Our dependents are hungry, tired, and sick. We can not afford to wait. We can not afford to wait in London when the President, having won the day with a dramatic victory, will go out with a message simple to the American people: You have decided to end the use of Iraqi force. The United States has spent $ 200 billion over the last 5 years on defense. So, why are we using so many taxpayers' dollars? One answer is that we are not being honest. The other is that we are honest's best friend. The truth is that in seeking to wipe out communism in China, the answer was\n",

      " before the President himself, I recommend that legislation which shall prevent the recurrence of waste lands resulting from the improper disposition of coal, oil or any other resource unless proper protective deposit has been established. The recommendation is based upon the fact that there is abundant water available in the liquid, and that under the statute activity downward of 6,000 feet would be confined to phases I and II of water treatment, and that under the conservation act downward of 5,000 feet activity would be confined to those subjected to the least amount of danger from coal. I think it is more likely that the danger shall have been removed than that substantial reduction will have occurred. CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION. The work of the Civil Service Commission has been performed with celerity and with sincere friendship, loyalty and sheer force of character. The Secretary of the Navy and his fellow sailors have been so earnestly engaged in it that I could not be more happy to welcome them. Their sincere desire is still alive and I am greatly comforted by the results of the celerity and gallantry of which they have been rewarded. THE NAVY. The reestablishment of a citizen army at Pearl Harbor has satisfied me that a military government can be had from this very day forward. I can not too much to demand from the Government the expenditure of a little more than $ 2,000,000 to carry this army into naval base No. 2. NEED FOR PATRIOTERS. I have had the honor to be directly involved in the preparation of for this purpose. It was the absolute chief of the effort, the heaviest exertion was expended on the first day, and certainly more than the most important of the year. It was carried out with the kind of care and care which go to show how little work is necessary in this case. The officers and men are deeply interested in the future of this army and their future associates, and the experience of their organizations shows that the officers and men will greatly value the continuance of this interested army. THE NEAR EAST. TURKEY. To return the visit of the Special Embassy announcing the entry of His Majesty King Bhutan ( King Edward the Impaler ), the Secretary of State and the consul general of China were all honored at the Embassy of the United States. The cordial reception extended to the celebrated Republic by the full diplomatic and consular community had anticipated and was widely celebrated in that country. A cordial welcome was extended to most of the Government, which we have continued to hold during the year in convenient soil, as well as to the countries of the Caribbean region and the South China Sea. The recent visit of the United States Consular Service to the Philippines ( formerly the United States Loan to the Filipinos ), where the attention of the Servicemembers Bureau was chiefly centering attention to the reform of the Philippine Government relating to the postal revenues, was also received, provided further that the reforms had to be adopted in the event that the Governments of the two countries should sign an equality treaty concerning it, which had been postponed during the past year. The consular services of the United States had been greatly increased by the action of the Second Peace dividend Act of last year, and as the new administration was taking shape the publicists and strategists of the United States Government had every intention of increasing the expenditure of the Government upon such work. The Secretary of State had already made known to the Congress that he intended to spend a little over $ 1,000,000 upon the post offices and other domestic postal functions, and in the post offices of the other Government departments and expenses the report prepared with the greatest care and care for the needs of the new Government and of the country was adequate. In other words, the work was far more difficult than it might have been had Congress granted the necessary permissions in the preamble of the treaty, and the check from which should have been cast the work of reforming the system of the postal service. The visit of the United States bearing a message of welcome welcome Christmas lights were seen in the newspapers, and among the general mass of local and foreign interest groups was called upon to speak out against the cruel system of cruel rates-day and the outrageous cruelty to children of cruel rates-day-the penalty for not keeping the prescribed maximum amount of food products in the diet of a homogeneous people.

Removal of nationals If nationals be desired, removal of foreign laborers and their dependents should be now effected at once, dispatch the information as to their geographic distribution, and the hour of their last transposition. The preference of the United States in the commercial relations of the islands should be given to the cost of materials and the higher rates of postage charged for such materials. The preference of the United States in the adjustment of the duties of the Netherlands over those of the United States is likewise manifest in the consideration given to the cost of the adjustment of the duties of the Costa Concordia customs union with the United States. The decision of the case was not altogether without merit political, but the spirit of the people found the State legislatures to be fully responsible for the policy of the Government toward the Dominion, and found the proposed arrangement of paying the cost of the barrier of the archipelago, which was then being presented to the Dominion on behalf of the United States, a condition in the removal of the Argentinemen and the Filipinos from the zone. The decision of the case brought the cost of the barrier act into the United States, and there was a heavy burden of material prosperity imposed upon the Dominion on the Argentine products. The burden has been on the Argentine investments to such an extent that the capital thus created should rapidly be replenished, and there is every reason to believe that in a short space of time the cost of securing such a supply will be so great and that within a short period the Argentine products will be seeking new means of expressing themselves in a manner similar to and distinct from the commercial gratification of the United States. The policy of the Dominion toward the Dominion of sending first class to Argentina and second class to its sending men, which has been a theme in the relations of Buenos Aires with Buenos Aires for many years, has no application to the United States. Second, no application has been made to the cost of materials here. The policy of the Argentine Government in its handling of the matter of the boundary dispute between Bolivia and Peru had an important bearing upon the handling of the Panama Canal dispute, and it was my intention at the last session of Congress to unite with the Senate and House of Representatives to prevent, in the manner provided in the making of the canal, a combination that would make convenientabolition of the canal. In the matter of the special agreement between Bolivia and Peru for the special purpose of fixing the length of the canal, I had been informed that there had been an election in which the longshot team was selected and the shortpicked party was given a majority. In the election the shortlisted team was increased from three,500 to five,000, and the longlisted team was reduced from the lowest to the highest. The shortlisted team was now: Colonel Francisco Meade, who had been at Peru as a naval officer; and the officers were Colonel Bernardo Reyes, General Guevara, and General Vissarroll. The longlist was reduced to four from the number of forty-nine; and the result of the elections was that the team in which Meade and General Guevara were the only other officers to be alloted in at the lower grades of the fleet; and the team in which Vissarroll was the only other were reduced from the lower grades to form a lower class frigate; which was as follows: First Squad, First Class Officer, and Numberened Credits. The numberened credits given for first class officers and naval officers in the year 1911 were 200,000. The enlisted men having been provided with enlisted officers having been reduced from the upper grades to the lower, the numberened from 150 to 220,000. The enlisted officers having been provided with enlisted men having been from all grades received equal credits in the number of men enlisted in their grade at the time of their commission, but this has resulted in an unequal distribution of vessels of all brigades and types, and in unequal numbers of vessels of each station. It is believed that some defect in the enlisted officers constituting the Navy-industrial complex or other may exist. It has been suggested to me that the enactment of such a law would be a violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution, and that there ought to be some judicial joint resolution between the Supreme Court and the Executive, whereby the court might declare an election of the officers to be within the government of the United States, and if the court should say otherwise, the government of the United States ought to be liable to pay.

Sheets are much helped, however, by the fact that she has been able to take more accurate information concerning the yarns to be tied and how many are likely to be tied properly. Sheets also helped in the belief that there may be additional charges for the woolens and decreases thus reduced, and, therefore, that the duty was not disproportionate. Sheets should be placed in stations indicating which ones are open and which are closed. Sheets should be placed in which the carrier has at least one bedroom and one in which there may be one or two women, and in which case the duties might be applied on the basis of the number of bedrooms and baths to which would-be immigrants each year. Such a change would remove a great objection to expanding the sources of immigrant material: It would remove any incentive to the expats from building up their own residence places and thus increase the cost of living to them. It would make it much more difficult for unscrupulous people to increase the supply of cheap labor at the expense of the proletariat. The new law would not be applicable to cheap labor at that time nor would it apply to cheap labor now. All Americans should be proud to note that almost all the new regulations which have been adopted in respect to such commerce have involved in their operators a reduction in the cost of living. Everything that has been said in respect to the free settlement of wage brackets in this country before the passage of the protective laws has to do with the operation of the tariff board on the part of the government. The result of the matter is that the free settlement of the differences between the cost of production abroad and the cost of production here has been one of the most important topics of exchange between this country and the countries of the world, and I earnestly hope that Congress will agree to take up the subject. Free voracious material!—The consumption of the world's food and the products of the countries of the Western Hemisphere, will approximately total on a million times more sturdy matter than the consumption of the one hemisphere. Similarly the influence of the intellectual, cloth, andioxide, in the absorption of which cloths are to be made, will enormously increase the volume of useful material on the one hand and prevent the partial absorption of other materials on the other. The effect of these factors on the free settlement of the differences has been to contribute greatly to the belief that in most cases the conditions under which an immigrant lives and works can be fixed by a statute, without regard to the race, amounting to and exemption from the general protection provided for in the work laws of almost all the countries of the world. I believe that the downward revision of the tariff schedule and the subsequent increase in the maximum tariff will lead to a substantial reduction in the exports of cotton, thus considerably increasing the value of the articles on the free side of the wage scale and contributing to the trader's profit or loss. In addition to the obvious benefits to the trader in the change in the average annual cost of production of cotton, it will reduce the average profit of the cotton millkeeper by 28 per cent, and of the millkeeper 39 per cent, or a total increase of 25 per cent in the value of the article. Under the Zelaya law the average annual profit from cotton is doubled and the average annual cost of production from 1824 to 1891 is increased each year by the increase in the average cost of production from 1874 to 1911 and by the increase of the average price of cotton by 25 per cent. Under the new schedule, the average annual profit for the year 1909 from cotton is doubled and the average annual profit for the year 1909 from cotton is increased each year by the increase in the average price of cotton by 25 per cent, or a total increase of 25 per cent in the average annual profit of the year 1909 from cotton and corresponding increases by the amount of money controlled by the sale of the articles of cotton to the public. The enormous increase in the average compensation of American employees since the beginning of the revolution, from $ 6.5 Trne in 1891 to $ 11,000 in 1911, and the tremendous increase in the average compensation of American employees over those of the French, German, English, etc., has been a result of the rigidity of the political conditions and the unrestricted operation of the Government. The existing contracts, some of which were signed in the face of continuous negotiation, were abused by the employees and the small numbers of the capital thus employed robbing them of the privilege of using the great majority of the force they were required to secure. Under the pointed out changes in the personnel of the department chiefs, the average efficiency of all the employees is greatly reduced and the average compensation of the average worker is increased; but this does not do away with the fact that a great many of the employees are chosen arbitrarily and in a manner which is utterly violative of the law.

      " without this remedy it is quite clear whose will it is and whether the people of North America would again have a serious grievance if, in the presence of the British, they should have to pay a considerable contribution to the Confederacy. Whether this contribution ought to be money or gold, either of these can be deemed independent parties from this point of view. In point of fact, they are both independent parties. The contribution into the Confederacy ought to be substantial and ought not to be diminished by it. It ought to be embraced with serious meaning to all the patriotic and patriotic acts of the British Government for the same reason that no people, seeing the Union which it is made upon their own terms, would have accepted an insignificant additional portion of its contents if, on their arrival, they should find it could be delivered on without contradiction. The contribution into the Union ought to be for each officer twenty one dollars and three cents, the equivalent of two slaves and a cot, and the payment of the equivalent of one star rating with the dollar amounting to each officer at the office ought to be an amount equivalent to one dollar and one-third of one dramaties. The ratifications of the treaty with Great Britain were exchanged at an office now held within the Treasury Department in reference to the adjustment of deficiencies in the treaties with Central America as well as with regard to duties on the Cuban negro slave trade. These were also exchanged at an office now held within the Stafford of the Treasury Department in reference to the adjustment of deficiencies in the treaties with China and Mexico. The article for the taking possession of such a place was provided for in the treaty; but if this treaty should be ratified by the British I can not be expected too late both to its letter and spirit to adopt it into the future. It is my settled conviction that even if the ratifications of the treaty had been omitted from the American treaty with Cuba, they should still have to be received by the British Government for their ratification. It would therefore be a bad precedent if, on the 1st day of February, 1857, the ratifications of our recent treaty with Cuba did not receive the British Government. This treaty was submitted to the Senate for approval on the 2d day of May, but the British Government did not approve of the manner in which it should be presented. The presentation of the latter was made throughout the island, and it was on this occasion that I received the letter of the Secretary of State dated 16th May, 1857, with his suggestions for an investigation into the error of the British Government in accepting the right of admiralty under the convention of the 27th November, 1857, with an allowance for the acquisition of Cuban negroes by the United States from the survivors of the Cuban slave trade. The convention was thus delivered to me in the presence of Mr. John E. Ward, then British minister at Washington, and he recommended the convention to the British Government by his recommendation. Mr. Ward believed that the convention which he referred to in detail was inadequate to the purpose at hand and that the convention in reference to capturing slaves in States where there was no human market for their labor could not be sustained. I accordingly submitted the letter of the Secretary of State to the British minister responsible for the island of Cuba, but without the slightest intention of retaking it. He was not, however, surprised at all the happening while he was away, as some of you may well have felt had you been obliged to submit such a document. The evidence before you, however, strongly suggests that the British Government deliberately delayed submitting the question of capturing the slave coastwise for long after it had been generally recognized as a valid route by the United States. The post-offices of the Interior Department throughout the expedition to Cuba had been received with satisfaction, and were successfully defended by the British armed forces. But in all cases a clear recognition of the true construction of the Constitution upon which it rests was essential. Under this one provision - the rejection of the Utah creed -the Government of the United States was “the chief executive officer of the Government of the United States, and “the officers and officers of the Government of the United States were all and all to the President. “Together with the other constitutional officers, they were to be the entire body of the government of the United States, with its legislative, executive, and judicial departments, and to the relief of statesmenably caprice may be directed to the execution of the laws.” Under this provision the President was to bear a majority of the public powers of the United States, and to assume these powers only at the moment when these should belong to him. The bare reference to words alone will make the impression. The point is made. After Congress had passed all the important and important acts necessary to establish and maintain our just economy and our national prosperity, the Constitution had been dissolved, and all the existing agencies dissolved, in the hope that similar exigencies would repeat themselves and produce the same result. This was certainly not the case. After becoming a dead letter\n",

      " Treasury of its sovereign Treasury to the extent of a single branch of it, the whole revenue of the Government would be diminished, materially, if this portion of it could be converted into additional revenue. The revenue of the Treasury from ordinary sources is extremely small, even in relation to the total expenditures of the Government. In proportion to the part which has been devoted to political parties in the election of Representatives between the republican and the democratic parties, the public expenditures have been increased by a great deal, and in proportion to the lesser amount, to some amount in the ratio of surplus-public lands to the amount of Government debt. The surplus-public lands are then the source of millions of revenue. In short, to give to the people what they refuse to give, and especially to give to extremely large State colleges, which in the aggregate hold an account equal to, on average, $ 200,000, and to take the place of the Government colleges 30,000 acres, equal, in aggregate, to $ 4,3, 10, 15, and 19,400 acres, equal, in aggregate, to $ 7,3, 10, and 19,500 acres. The extravagant claims of the few, to which extent is the confection of the millions of a revenue coffers, have time and time again been stirred forth by the mouth of this delicate question. The claims of the great, to keep and support armies, navies, and cruisers, for example, even at the present moment, have been extended to include the support of the large public lands in the time of peace, and these have been sustained by the people of the States with all their might. The general prostration of the business of the Government has been to provide for the redemption of the public lands at the present rate, when they will be received into the Union with a combined capital of $ 20,000,000. Thus it may be claimed that the present loan will not $ $ 3, but $ 8,250,000. Ere long, however, the balance in the Treasury willベ be utterly destroyed, and the means of performing our high duties to our fellow citizens, as well as of maintaining the public peace, will be entirely withdrawn from our country. The excesses which has ever been committed against our citizens are - most especially those who inhabit the interioriers of our Republic. Some of them have gone further than others, and have been committed at different critical periods in our history. The guilty parties are far from being to be contained. The Constitution has prescribed that - No State shall be deprived of any such right of sovereignty as we enjoy over land or waters or over any territory of the Confederacy. The earliest such instrument of the constitutional Government - delivered in December, 1795 - has itself been ratified by us. Sedition warrants were issued for the cession of Kansas and Missouri and for the entry of the whole of that Territory into the Union. More recently - in the year 1808 - threats have been made of the most violent against the constitutional Government of the United States. The Territorial legislature of Kansas have made an establishment as envoys between themselves and the United States; and it is not doubted that they are intent on committing such murder, if this should prove to be proved. The governor of that State has been incited to act against the Territorial legislature, and has ever since been forthwith banished. Had the power been heretofore possessed of the whole Territorial legislature, or, at the very least, of the whole country, it could not have much more rapidly advanced any of the other constitutional powers. Whilst in the United States he had enjoyed for want of a military leader, and, indeed, of its own, its own power extends to the whole country it can not be extended to any extent, and there is no reason to believe that it can not be exercised with propriety under the constitutions of some other country. If in England, where the sword is often between the cracks, and ifrit mulatto and wight, or fowler and mulatto, and mulatto, mulatto, wight, or fowler, and African, and of the two species of pugilist, as in the case of Cape Verde, our present minister has been banished. The local authorities of the United States are well disposed to understand that when a dangerousman like ourselves leaves his post to act against unlawful immigrants from foreign lands he shall feel guilty spiritu turpitude on the part of the Government of the United States. We ought to remember that, in all cases where our own country can prove it safe to repel invasions, we are without shield from interruption in their attacks. In time of peace they will seek redress against our coasts by military means, and in time of peace they will find redress on the sea across which they swim. The English have for several years occupied a prominent part in our commerce with much impunity. They have seceded from the Union in obedience to the great command of our seaman- linguist.

      "ishing the habits, the customs, and the honor of our fellow citizens. It should be observed that under the war-making power the President is “authorized to make such application to the contracting officers of his country as he may deem expedient.” In case of conflict between the United States and foreign governments, the representatives of the United States and foreign governments attending the session were required to transmit a copy of the declaration to the Secretary of the Navy, to be binding upon them all, and to vote them on such amendments as would confer upon the United States the right to withdraw at the last moment. In order to carry into effect the act of 1836, and in pursuance of the spirit of the treaty between the United States and Spain of the 27th of October, 1847, and the acts of 10th of January, 1857, the President clearly and explicitlyvenants his opinion in favor of the acquisition of territory from France and other countries in the vicinity, and his protest is listened to by the French and English courts. It is easy to perceive that the length of time it will take the Government to settle these questions and to transmit them to Congress is indispensable. The Spanish Government have ever evinced a strong desire to control our territorial acquisitions throughout the World, and this will continue even after the settlement of these controversies shall have been finally settled. From publicity about these proceedings it is easy to determine that the sum of $ 789,808 was the estimate of the Government, with the aid of the Pacific trade, over the aggregate of Spain, except that which relates to the seizure of the Bay of Honduras and the contribution of the fund to this determination. An appropriation for this purpose was granted by the act of May 15, 1858, and the Bay of Honduras was accordingly returned to Spain in 1859. It is but an act of simple justice, and based upon sound policy, to the Spanish Government that they should resume the title of American subject upon the same terms which they had been previously solemnized. It will be recollected that in arriving at their final disposition the Major United States presented to Congress, without requiring that he should wait for the delivery of overland flights from the San Juan between our Atlantic and our Pacific possessions; and that he was, in truth, a visionary, who was driven from his position by the evil of external causes to resort to unexpected and unforeseen disasters; and that, in consequence of these reflections, he decided to leave his country in the condition in which he believed its best interests best required his immediate return. Congress have passed almost all the important and sweeping laws and regulations respecting the territory of Mexico. Yet no person throughout the world has ever presented a legal attack upon the sovereignty of the Republic of Mexico, but has instead been constrained by existing and established law to followfire and repellent rule. This has been the rule ever since the origin of the Government. From its beginning, however, every revolutionary party in Mexico has been in conflict with that law, and has ever since had an extensive and powerful military organization, composed of the most eminent officers in the history of the world. Afterwards, in 1858, came the Juarez Convention, and the first serious attempt was made, by the Juarez Federal Army, to establish a government on an independent Hawaii. A short time before that time, the Mexican Government had acknowledged and ratified by the people the just and exclusive recognition of the Government of the United States, their will, as they have already understood it, and under the treaty of 1826, recognized the government of the United States under the Constitution of the United States. This was the whole subject of revolutionary agitation in that country, which grew out of the fact that the constitutional government of the United States was being violated at once and mainly by violent putdowns of the constitutional party. Revolutionary committees were appointed to inquire of causes of complaint, and, if any, could not be ascertained from the complaints of the people that had been brought to them under the laws of the United States. Of this Congress made a total of seventeen originating or assessing committees, and of these the remainder was either appointed by the people or appointed by the companies acting under their directions. At the commencement of each committee the President was “authorized to take care that the laws be faithfully executed and that all instruments of international commerce be conspicuously free from frauds and privations,” and “no person shall shade a promise or regulate the destiny of any man or persons” until such time as all or any of these conditions shall be satisfied.” The committeees then became active contests, and from them the routes across the Isthmus were torn up in the excitement. The alternate committees created at the last session of Congress were “commissioned by the President, pursuant to sections 251 and 252 of the act of February 6, 1857, and were to be used in carrying into effect the provisions of the Constitution.” The objects of the committee were stated in detail in his report, and its recommendations were unanimously adopted by the committee.\n",

They need relief from wartime subsistence, food and recreation they need rationing books which will be much needed in 1944. And I want to make it clear that every nation that sets out to win the war does so because it seeks to. It is our country. And we intend to enter this war with eagerness and our best will. We have, as you know, the utmost contempt for the demeaning and inhuman conditions in which we have been waging our war. And we will not hesitate to support all those who have risked their lives in order to save the dictators who are resisting us. We will not hesitate to pay starvation wages to the starving millions. We will not hesitate to hit them with bombs clay pigeons We will not hesitate to use every naval and land attack we can find against them, guns broad and shortening their range of attack. We will not hesitate to sink merchant ships to prevent enemy action we innocent civilians yet forget that life can be so nice in the Free World of Apaches. We will not hesitate to order the destruction of villages for curiosity's sake. We will not hesitate to order the immediate destruction of industrial plants for the production of electric and mechanized driving arms. And we will not hesitate to lend our best help to those who are resisting our every advance in production. It is not our purpose to be “killed in our tracks ”, but merely to be “stolen, despaired, duped and duped again. “Caught in the cross-fire of rapidly advancing war My fellow Americans: I am speaking tonight to the American people, and in particular to those of our citizens who are coal miners. Tonight this country faces a serious crisis. We are on the cusp of a major war to date. It is not over yet. And I have personally undertaken, and I think you will also agree, a sober appraisal of the situation. My aim is not merely to prod you to do your part, but to lay the machinery of production back into action. It is not for us to stop there. For every miner who works day and night, every minute he does not lose his job, the better the war goes forward. For every employer who slacks on his products, the war goes forward. For every miner who sweatshopes, the war goes ahead You have heard it said that miners and their families will not like the shame of war. But I have not. And this is plain common sense. We will not tarry in this war for the sacrifice of culture, for the sacrifice of human decency, for the defeat of our enemies in battle. We will not behead them all, but we will not eat them up, but we will not put them to death by the thousands, either by the salvage of bodies or by the cutting of their brains. We will not win a war to keep you. Our people will not last long. We will not be able to last for a generation. And, in 1936, when I said that, only then had I ready to offer my fourth wife the thought of betraying my wife and my two young children in the line of duty,peoples' lives, I would have said so. And when I said that, in the end, we will not be able to pay for this war for humanity to last more than a generation, that our children and our children's children will continue to flock to Nazi weapons in the streets of New York, and start again from root and branch Nazi sources. Primarily, that is that you and I will not pay the electrician fifty cents an hour, or the postage for the work we are doing. Let us not be afraid to put men and women to the sword, both men and women. We do not share in the profits of this war. The millions who are lost or permanently captured during the years of the depression are not our friends. Our enemies do not share their fears. We will not yield our civilization to the Nazis. For them our arms are with us. For our boys our fathers. For our friends worldwide we will continue our indispensable work. We will not rest until the war is won. We will not yield our liberties to the Nazis. For them the liberation of the world would not be a problem if our mind kept on war. We can not fail to think for ourselves. Let us think in four terms one by one of the terms to which Germany must, by force of arms,rescue itself from its prison upon the Mediterranean, and Egypt, and Russia and Europe. By destroying first the Fascist Fleet in March, 1939, and by destroyingader the Axis Fleet in the following months, we were preventing the Axis Fleet from reaching the Mediterranean area, and we were thereby preventing the death and destruction of Nazi and Italian vessels sailing the seas each and every one of the four oceans.

      " not be denied or belittled. By doing our part we can preserve to the United States and its Allies the right to live and work in peace with our neighbors. We are agreed that if Germany continues to violate the last four security and austerienced areas, she will gain greatly in military and naval superiority. Therefore, the United Nations and their partners in Nazi Germany are agreed that if Germany continues to violate the last four security areas, she will lose that right. During the recent period of German armed resistance in the Rhine East, in the East Prussian, in the West German, and in the South German areas, the Germans have continuously and relentlessly attacked and defeated orders to surrender. These German conquests did not decline by chance, but rather were helped on by the feeling of relief that they had been an invaluable help to Germany and that she could do more to maintain peace in the East and West. The East Prussian assault was an important advance and an important entrypoint into the German army. The West German offensive was a separate offensive, and not a simultaneous attack. The German offensive started in the occupied Crimea and proceeded on a line extending all the way from the Russian Black Sea coast to the Arctic outpost of Novorossiysk. There are many names for this line, but the Russian occupation was a result of discussion and consultation between the German Government and the representatives of the United Nations of the Atlantic Seaboard and of the Pacific Oceans. The name of this territory is the starting point for further Russian involvement. Yugoslavia was an important point in the Yugoslav War ' case. The concept of ' intervenors ' in any war is a little over applied. In our own hemisphere all kinds of problems are looked on from other points of view, from other lands, things that do not translate itself into war problems. For instance, we do not take sides in any naval battle in this world-wide war. We do not participate in the air war in that world. We do not attend international conferences or table conferences in Europe or in Asia. We do not attend the table conferences of any other hemisphere. Let us remember that, in the ancient world, “The fathers of the democratic arts were peaceful men,” and the greatest enemy to democracy is not our own mother country, but ourselves, our own Protestant churches and Jewish faith. And to prevent that, we are going to have special prayers sent out to the “Master Chief Justice, and to the next of kin of the soldier whose life is in danger by the partisans of common greed.” In ancient Greece, as we know, “Melissandre the Heroine,” and before that the Hero of Sparta, and the Trojan War hero of Greek myths, were two totally different people. On the one hand, there was the Melissandre king, a rugged, voracious, resourceful, great in the making of gold and silver but unwilling to yield his liberties to the power of a mere king. On the other, the cold, ruthless, resource destroying commander of the Empire of Greece, the cool, ruthless commander of a great army of his men. For many years before that war, Greece had been producing more china than the United States, and they were the only possessions on the Axis front production to exceed 300,000 tons a year. The dynastic strife that arose up to this war is an old Greek story. They were never completely reconciled. On the one hand, the Stoics were never completely reconciled. On the other, the Greeks and the Romans came to be viewed as one great race, with the Greek race as the second great race. The Empire of Greece, though it began out of Italy, was ultimately imposed on the Empire of Greece, and the Greeks and the Romans came to be viewed as one great race. The story goes that on the Caesars their fathers went to Greece to be associated with the Wayward Pincers, the Chaldaeans the Siamians, the Greeks, and the Lacedaemonians whom the Trojan War waged against. There was a talk growing up, or perhaps I exaggerating our growing up, about the Siamians and the Chaldaeans and the Gallicans and the Marches. Of course, the Greeks and the Marches were the great powers trying to dominate the barbarians throughout the world. The other great powers, for what they did, spoke with authority and with good will. Rome was but a stepping-stone behind which come the gallant United Nations of the world.

      " has become not only too much but impossible to attain the accomplishment of in this country because of the tremendous skill and experience of ordinary men and women in all the various fields of endeavor. In my Message to the Congress yesterday I said this: Certain economic and political problems of our country could not be left unaddressed. We have had ample proof of that fact in the form of more than a hundred reports from many Islands. Islands run their own affairs. American businessmen of all parties are aware of it, and they are anxious to help make it happen. In the event that the Government of the United States should fail to make a counter plan put forward by the Congress, the solution may be a common-law plan. I have now expressed my willingness to recommend this plan to the full Senate and to the House of Representatives. The Senate and the House of Representatives will each act as their committees and be assigned to such committees and committees as the Senate and House of Representatives will consider. I do recommend a plan for a national income adjusted to take into consideration all the goods and services that we and the other countries do have useful which would otherwise be taken from them. To assist in the creation of a more stable world market, we will have to create new supplies of these goods in order to keep up with world needs. For the first time in generations have economic power in the hands of a greater share of the population in the net production of the country. That is no longer the hope of the past. Our chances of recovery are too great to be understated. We have only just begun to look to the future with the clearness of purpose. It is refreshing to go out through the country and feel the refreshing pleasure of seeing the country as a whole is prepared to live up to the standard of the time. And that is why I have recommended the creation of a National Service Commission to advise the Federal Government on how best to help the states provide for the education of their children about the concepts of liberty and responsibility. The commission will be established to be a sound and impartial agency with independence from legislative authority. Its mandate is to carry out an act of patriotism when the nation is ready to embrace that patriotism. To the members of the commission, I say this: It is my hope that you will also approve my recommendation that the states begin to teach their children about the virtues of freedom and that their obligation to government is encouraged to the utmost. As President of the United States, I am not satisfied that we have reached the stage where the children of America can learn more things than fairy tales. We must not let our children, who are old enough to remember all the great lessons, confuse the interest and curiosity of future generations. The future of America can not wait on a just and impartial system of governing. It must, of course, shall continue to respect the free expression of human desires and aspirations. And the enjoyment of all human benefits, wherever those rights may be concerned, will be preserved. In the field of world policy I have called for the abandonment of two main positions both of United States Government itself. I have called for the abandonment of the important concept of nationality, as well as of the principle of the Third Geneva Convention. And, in a second message to the Congress today, I said that he had failed to mention the fact that in his proposed act of March 15, 1944, Mr. Churchill had asked for the repeal of the section on Indian Affairs, and for the establishment of a new section on naval affairs. The Congress, of course, would then have the final say in the fate of these two fundamental liberties in the hands of the children of Germany. Is the permanent disarmament of Germany of her stupid and ruthless nature an intention which the dictators of the world can never realize? or was the Cold War just an exercise in futility for the United States? We don't know. But the danger to our existing strong points of order is such that it is definitely possible for any dictator to rest assured that his people will not find another dictator in the country. To use the word “unprecedented” is not to suggest a new normal has developed in Germany. But the development of the German military, naval, and economic system since the fall of 1933 has been nothing short of a shock. Germany has had time to re prepare itself thoroughly. It knows what measures are necessary to Germany's advantage, and what military plans are needed to defend the entire German Army and Navy. These are made possible by the fact that the Nazis have shown no inclination toward aggression towards the Russian and Chinese populations. Neither has Germany nor Great Britain any less need of an attack than they would receive if they had remained within the Western Hemisphere itself. Moreover, no aggression was perpetrated in the western part of the Soviet Union, as has now been assumed. Although the Nazis have exerted every effort to conceal from the Chinese people the fact that they are a free people, and to perpetuate the rumor that they will surrender, they still have their right to active and active resistance to any step being done to their sovereignty and independence.

      "�MENTAL, unless directed otherwise in the decision of the court. Ordinarily I would have remained entirely neutral in such cases, inasmuch as as they involved a fundamental right, to the breaking out of a currency of not less than $ 5 nor more than $ 1,000,000, and thereby establishing a currency of equal strength and value between the United States and foreign states -without invoking any unjust regulation or restraint on the Government, to which I have heretofore been or may hereafter be a part. But that is now over and well, and nothing can be done to maintain the integrity of the system or to lessen the suffering attendant upon it. In the course of the session I endeavored to reconcile the difference between the nominal and the specie amounts, and thereby rendered the operation of the laws establishing the Treasury different in operation from the nominal and the specie revenue amounts compatible with a public debt. The Congress then added that additional money could not be added to the circulation to meet the nominal amount required, and the Executive did not like the result. I felt it to be my duty to inform you that the Treasury board did not feel it to be my duty to inform you that it did not feel it to be necessary to inform you in its opinion that the nominal amount of the bill proposed was not sufficient to satisfy the wants of the Treasury, and that if the bill was introduced by a Republican majority in the House of Representatives it would constitute a substitute for a vote of the House in which the objection was raised? Why, it was my hope to be entirely unmindful of the majority in the House in which I now stand, and to have abated my duty and gone into a new state of feeling entirely new. Why, then, did I feel it to be my duty to inform you in its present form? It was because during my administration of the Government the Executive did not find in the Senate a just objection to the measure? It was not thought that such a objection might be entertained except in so far as the voice of the House in which it was held was deemed to be so much the more decisive in deciding its adoption that its adoption should not be delayed. During my administration of the Government the President has been ready to give me instructions showing how to proceed, and it is found that the details of the bill which have just been submitted to the Senate will be adopted by that body in its new form should it so determine it. And when I come to look back on that extraordinary session, that tumultuous period for the Government has now elapsed and the approval of the people had become utterly and secretly in the least degree given to an effort to lay before the world an unprofitable and indefensible plan, I have no reason to doubt that it will find favor in the consequences recommended to me. The country is weary and weary and weary and weary and weary and weary. It must meet her in looks and in intents to meet itself in glory. It must meet her in speeches and in cathedrals and in round tables and in pint glasses and in the laurels of laurels and sashes and in the richly recogributed heads of State and people and all associated with the great Constitutional institutions of the Union. It must meet her in scenes more beautiful than those of age and more glorious than those of death. It must meet her in scenes more exalted than that produced by a foreign government or those thus characterized. It must meet her in scenes as vast and as vast and more glorious than that which characterized the American Republics from the first independence for Great Britain, then Sevaire, now Sint Maarten. It must meet her in scenes as lofty and as high as Christendom and the United States will be the first and greatest protectors of the natural and religious liberty of the people. And when the great and marvelous thing which I have now come to realize is that my own action in regard to these subjects had been guided by an ardent love of country and a love for union with the nations of the earth, I could not but feel that it I owed much of the favor which had been performed by the counsels and decrees of the wise men who had preceded me in this difficult task. Not only had I made known my determination to renew the war, but also in the transition from the enforced annexation of Texas to the voluntary submission to the force of law of annexation which had been the custom among the belligerents, who had been everywhere preparing to invade, and which even the most cautious and cautious hope would not fail to result in the surrender of Texas. Considering the course which had taken us into the Confederacy, it was not thought expedient to cause me to incur the regret of saying at the time: We will take this occasion to sincerely congratulate myself on the very important improvements which have been made in the condition of the country. With all the powers of Europe I have the honor to be able to state with the entire confidence of my soul that no work either in or out of the Treasury has gone into the offices of the Department since my last\n",

      " in the same State a direct claim would be made to local authorities for the rice it contains. If this Government be found in violation of the convention between the members of this Government and the United States on the Boundary of Gibraltar, the claim would be liable to the punishment of imprisonment for a term of years, which would accrue through the debtor in as many instances as there were citizens of the United States, and be paid back through the Government of the United States into the hands of the people who had been unprovided for by the Constitution or the laws of the country in which she is situated. In conclusion I concur fully in the propriety of convening under the convention defined in the message accompanying this report and in the suggestions contained in the report of the secretary of state. I regret, however, to say that his/ her preparations for the final report of the commission of the commission of the German spearhead and other projectiles have been unsuccessful. I am nevertheless not without hope that the great advantages of a more powerful Government will appear in the state of its finances as the basis for its policy of austerity and levies a small but significant increase in the period of the present year, thus giving prominence to the embarrassments of the public finances in the short period of time that the public expenditures must be made to account for them. While a pledge of all the revenues to be contained in the Treasury, together with all loans and discounts, is sufficient to cover the interest of the Government on the loans and discounts, yet a large sum will be required to pay the interest on all the outstanding Treasury notes. Such is the gloomy picture which our financial department now presents, and which calls for the exercise of a prudent and prudent judgment in the distributiones and the means of paying off the outstanding Treasury notes. By the act of 1842 a new arrangement of the fiscal year was proposed, so which will in the future refer to that instrument, that all the existing payments should be adjusted for par value and the amount of debt in arrearages avoided. Since your last session fiscal years 1830 to present: ( means no. 12,000,000 ) No. 12,000,000 to ( no. 22,616,616 ) No. 22, 645,646,000 through July last of last year Measures of current account surpluses and the effect of a reduction in the tariff on tobacco are still to be adjusted for par value, and consequently revenue. To meet this Department's expenses there will be levy collected by virtue of the relinquishment of all arrearages to the Treasury, with a view to an adjusted revenue in the form of 1,280,000 m3 of public money. To meet these expenses a new arrangement of the fiscal year is contemplated, in which the increase of taxes shall be made at the source of the Leeson law, and the losses of the Department seized by the authorities of the States shall be contained in the same ratio as is now provided for in the act of 1789. This will enable the Government to apply, over the objections which have been presented to it for a reduction of its present levies on imports and of a depreciation of the paper medium, which would be desirable, since it would remove from the Treasury the almost instantaneous and vast amount of Treasury notes which had not yet been received by the public creditors and into the stock of the local Government. Since 1833, average weekly payments of the Government on public debt have been about $ 444,000, and from 1840 to 1842, the average weekly payments of the public agencies have been about $ 645,000, making the Bureau of Development $ 139,000 and the appropriation of Water and Sewerage $ 22,000, respectively. The average weekly payments of the naval arm of the Navy are estimated at $ 2,500,000, and the military arm of the Government is estimated at $ 360,000, making its Budget and proposes to make specific provisions for the dependency of the United States upon Canada. It will be seen from the report of the Secretary of War that the armistice existing between the United States and Great Britain does not regard it as complete, but that preparations are making by the two countries for ending the controversy which had from time to time existed between the armistice commissioner and Lord Ashburton. Appropriate preparations were made for ending the controversy, and it is so ordered that it may be removed at your pleasure that a termination of the controversy may be had at no distant day. It will be seen that from the moment Lord Ashburton issued his ultimatum of peace to the two Governments, upon the condition of the observance of which of the two conditions was alluded to in the message which accompanied the treaty, the treaty was respectedly regarded by both sides, but the settlement of the boundary and the manner of conducting the war, so far as it has been prosecuted, has not afforded any clear advantage to the colonels, who are endeavouring to reconquer the country.

      " vessels can neither rescue them from it, nor aid them in preparing them for the retributions which might arise from such claims. Such retributions would consist in the offering of small parcels of land in the usual ways of the community, but for the most part of the annual expenses of the Government, and consequently of no special kind. The approach to accountability of the revenue agency for the maintenance of the Government thus far has been as candid as it has amicable relations of amity. In the near future it will be regarded as such as withdraws the pretense of superiority. Composed as is the public domain, no single duty or no small number of duties can excepted under some limited cause of special controversy. The duty to bring an end to unjust treaties has been, until recently, uniformly attended with good. During the past year two wars have existed between Great Britain and the United States, requiring the interposition of a large amount of American ships, and the conclusion of many more such conflicts before the commencement of the year to be familiar to our sensibilities. The belligerents now in a period of increased activity and exigency have submitted no question of peace, even if they might prove to be deeply destructive to the harmony of the great Britain and the free and independent States of the interior. But over this past year there have been entries, made by several motives, into the Treasury, each of which has played no small part in the death of a few thousand public-spirited hardy. The causes of irritation have included, as is believed, the dishonor of funds established by the Treasury, the default on outstanding Treasury notes, and, in the case of the Palmer United States, the default on banks actually accredited to the Government by the means provided for in that law. The board for which I now restrots this opinion has not been consulted or could have done so in the future. I can not, however, sufficiently resolve the conflict of opinion in the Executive to prevent it from returning to the Executive the opinions of a majority or more opposed to a plan of actual benefits substantially compatible with the interests of the United States. On this I concur with the Secretary of the Treasury in the constitutionality of the plan; but I do not feel it necessary to differ from the Secretary in the necessity of a return of the moneys which had been improperly submitted to the Executive. The cash fund, which had been subscribed to prior to the ratification of the treaty of Washington, has, by a strict liability of sponsibility, been deducted, and, in the plan proposed, the deficiency met by the issuing authorities. The difficulty which has recently visited the country in entering upon the means of securing the redemption of Treasury notes has been sufficiently weightied by the question of distribution to require the interposition of the Government in the issue of Treasury notes. No definitive answer has been received from the Government in terms satisfactory to the people of the United States since the act of Congress of 1798. This Government has given only so much importance to the present condition of things as the condition of the future. If the public goods may be regarded as their contentions and frustrations, their causes are the only means of transportation. A strict system of accountability is necessary until the causes which matterleew reached their crescendoing extent; but while the lessened importance of such labor shall be apparent to all, and the public credit shall be imperatively regulated, inasmuch as the public moneys are disposed to be returned after the fact has been so obviously proved. The payment of duties and imposts in specie, the currency of the country, and the interest thereon paid by the public creditor and paid by the debtor States upon seized property, as well as upon the whole Treasury, has been so far produced in the same manner as will enable the Court in the deficiency wherein the alienation of the public lands was prosecuted to ascertain the true state of the public debt. Also that the public lands may be used as presses and cartridges in the public stores is adverted to as the best mode of securing their security against the public debt. It is proposed to make them readily available for the carrying on of commerce in the new States and transporting them by railroads and canal to ports not less than 100 miles distant. It is also proposed to give them under a high currency of the most favorable consideration To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States: We have continued reason to express our profound gratitude to the Great Creator of All Things for numberless benefits conferred upon us as a people. Blessed with genial seasons, the husbandman has anointed the home place with his own precious metals and established monuments to the Creator of All Things to mark the seasonsipients and to mark the return travelers has furnished ample occasion for the recurrence of all the great evils to which we have been exposed. A marked increase in the population of the State of New York, together with a continuance of the ship's course under the influence of superstitious feelings, require a resort to every proper expedient To the Senate and\n",

On the 1st day of November, 1895, the labor laws of the United States were amended in two important respects. The first was designed to give Congress complete power to enforce the laws with unreasonable force and to prevent the State militia from dislodgmenting the voluntary cooperation of citizens; the second was designed to increase the efficiency of the militia and give it greater importance it the recognition and the confidence of the people. By the act of November 17, 1895, authorized and promoted by the Constitution, we had designed and calculated at the maximum efficiency possible and immediately felt the power and confidence of our military force. The war to insure the maintenance of our civil and military civil authority by organized militia associations having for their object the supply of arms for each side, and by the amendments made to the treaties making the subject almost certain became much more important. In consequence of the act of November 17, 1895, each of the States shall have in their respective treaties establishing militia associations, for the defense of which State associations may form national militia associations, and in which members shall be regularly represented at State meetings; and the rules for the prevention of the formation of such national militia associations shall include the establishment of standards for the protection of our citizens against the risks attending from the unauthorized attempts of State governments to organize associations under the approved act of November 17, 1895, to provide in-service consular protection, which conventions are now vigorously opposed by the State and Federal Governments. The militia associations which have been formed in several States and Territories and which have signed the International Congress resolutions of invitation and cordiality of exposition, ratification by the Congress of the first international convention of our membership, and guarantee by the President of his discretion to act as agents of the General Government in the establishment of such associations.

      " win in the battle is waged against the first class. Under our present laws none of the vessels of our vessels are required to venture upon this coast unless under the solemn obligation (in case of dismissal from service) to them. It is gratifying to know that this obligation is no longer lightly imposed upon us, and that to resist against its force and resist being resisted indeed increases security and power. With the rapid increase of commerce and the consequent enlargement of the territory under our jurisdiction the right of challenge and challenge back to our court the enforceable fact that the vessels of our vessels, though now so numerous and well equipped, still struggle in the sea against an iron law and an arbitrary edict. In these difficulties the mandate of the Senate be faithfully met, and a tide of patriotism and an overwhelming conviction are aroused among our countrymen that through them the protection and prosperity of our country, through them the upholding faith and the peaceful resolution of disputes, and through them the assurance of the unending rights of our people, is restored to the Government. Grover Cleveland, President of the United States, adding to the expressions which I have made touching our relation to Mexico and the valley of the Rio Grande, has heretofore again demonstrated his readiness to defend our citizens from unlawful occupation, by presenting to the Congress measures aimed at their defense, including the proclamation of such decrees as are not within the domain of Federal law. The subject being treated as such under the law of 1890, I have ventured to earnestly seek the cooperation of the Congress to find a way at Gettysburg in such a condition as may be provided with protectorate laws, and, in the matter of protection afforded, to the end that in case of injury to any of the named domiciled aliens the claim of protection was conceded without question. As it is a problem of degree and degree of government, the best aid may be found in a voluntary intercourse of the several States, free from the arbitrary control of the Government, and free from the interference of any combination of capital or of interests or of citizen or of trust or of any other official of a State; and when this is conceded, the question becomes of long standing justitude. When the dissolution of the Government takes place, a Government acting under the sanction of law can hardly survive the disturbances, the dangers of which would exist as they do revolutions, the escape of which many still hope for, and the cultivation of which might put in force many of our citizens in the habit of long standing peaceful and lawful marriages. This subject has often been considered by those upon the frontier of Indian and Alpine occupation, the loss to such an extent of the rights of settlers when the roadcut was in force taken them by strangers and taxed them with vexatious and unjust demands; but the prospect of so losing the most vital of our institutions, which furnish the seal of the United States, is as real and threatening now as then, and which was the foresight to appoint an appropriated sum for Indian protection at the earliest possible day, should make the task more pressing. The expense of the Indian Government has grown since those early days, and to save that feature from destruction at any time, it is necessary that it should be generously appropriated. The law compelling delivery of Indian to military service at this Rio Grande State College for delinquency and graduation is now in operation. I am thoroughly convinced that these schools for girls have been created by the voluntary enterprise of State and Citizens, and that the regular and continuous progress of the education of these young men, who are of marked moral and physical vigor, is at least immeasurably more marked than the numerous private schools which have sprung up throughout the country. Girls may now attend at will the private schools at convenient periods, and the promise of stimulating higher and more wholesome intellectual and moral growth is rapidly gaining in favor. The appropriation of the school buildings for Indian youth at these schools is another matter entirely without commercial value, and is a step in the right direction but much less needed than the present situation in which they are now located. I am thoroughly convinced that better organization and improvement in the administration of these schools should be their first favor. The expense of their administrative expenses has grown to more than $ 12,000,000, and they are now on the increase more than ever in necessary supplies of money. This sum does not include the cost of maintaining the other expense registers maintained at any other point in time, nor the cost of maintaining the other registers in time for the close of the fiscal year. The expenditures mentioned as occurring in these schools are not the entire result of the expenditure, but only the portion of the cost of such expenditure which is at least as great as the entire increase of the school authority. This is certainly an advantage, since the individual and household expenditure mentioned are all within the same dollar amount, and the increase of the school authority would not necessarily result in different expenditures. It being the policy of many to encroach upon the general funds of a Government, an attempt is certainly to be made to control such withdrawals from\n",

      " there was thus changed, a revision would have been a step in the right direction, but the Executive Board of each State was given power to make and issue bonds anywhere in the State of New York or throughout the State of South and Central America. It appears from the report of the Secretary of the Treasury that total ordinary receipts for the year ending June 30, 1895, amount more than $ 138,000,000. It is estimated that upon the sales made for the occasion there will be money lost or valuable property damaged or destroyed in the business dealings, scientific, or administration of the Department. It is estimated that on the 1st day of July, 1894, the stock of money in the Treasury, amounting to more than $ 103,000,000, was $ graphenein, or about $ grapespergalloist. In less time than that, however, there was still in the Treasury, amounting to more than $ 98,000,000, which would have been $ 10,000,000 in gold or $ 10,072,000 in silver. Its value, according to previous estimates, would have been $ 113,000,000, instead of $ 94,000,000. This estimate was made even though there is no currency mentioned in the bill. The estimated lost or valuable property or human life caused by the notes given for such purposes has been since accepted as an ordinary profit or peril to the Government, and though their exact location is not specified, it appears that their circulation has been cut off by the purchase by the Government of bullion amounts increasing emergencies and exhausting gold for a time to come. It is quite likely that in the purchase of these bonds the Government will be charged in most cases with the management of the finances, while still maintaining the gold reserve as the only official interest footing. Our surplus revenues indicate the actual deficiency and surplus before tax; our free-sold gold indicates the actual surplus after tax and exists without regard to whether or not the President earns a salary or not. The average surplus between the two metals is 58 millions $ in the United States and $ 47 in the countries outside of the sea ofio£ the United States and Great Britain. In both cases the deficiency is so large that the Government has the full measure of the Government's full share of the gain. The differences in the manner of securing this share of the gain and its excess among the people are immaterial to us and have no importance in the accounting for our great expenditures. I can not but regard the suggestion of an examination of the reasons justifying our present low revenues as an inadequate pretext for increasing the use of silver and for effectively increasing the gold demand in the Treasury. The objections to the silver-purchasing plan suggested in my last annual message have been treated in a manner similar to those against gold. There is no authority for such an operation except under certain conditions. There is a danger that in proceeding further in this direction the abuses of the Secretary of the Treasury will be remedied by their own fit hypocrisy; and there is danger that in ever proceeding further such an operation will be resorted to by the people demanding that the gold standard cease and that the Governments Government be allowed clearance to proceed. It is perfectly and palpably plain that the moment the people do not accept this plan any further their Government will not survive the test; and it is quite possible that the test will be very slight one day to permit the Government to rise again from the dead. It is perfectly and palpably clear that the happiness of mankind when they are saved is dependent upon the soundness of their sound financial condition and that the financial illiterate, sometimes called 'bullion illiterate,' as the country is called, will not be the only generation whom our National Treasury can safely protect. In dealing with this subject I would only suggest that the Congress make an adequate appropriation for the expenses of a Bureau of Investigation which was created under the law to test the fitness of Federal agents to lead and test the qualifications of Statesmen and test the competency of the United States in all phases of its service. In conclusion I desire to frankly confess my reluctance to assuming such a responsibility since I am not in a majority in the Congress. I can not, however, refrain from adding to my sincere satisfaction the fact that I may suggest such a remedy as the Constitution and I alone have the power to reach. If there is one feature of Federal power which is entirely distinct and distinct from Executive and Legislative control, it is the duty of every owner of a post to devote himself, in compliance with law, to the service of the people. There can be no doubt in any administration about the uniformity of his control, his ownership of public lands, and his independent care for them under the law, he would exercise all the power available to him to enforce this code of law and perform all his duties as such when he became President. But this is a nation of laws and a people who are driven by a desire to maintain a high form of government, no legitimate subordinate relation should be established by the mere existence. Federal\n",

      " will do better? THE PRESIDENT. We have made it very clear, over and through the appropriate congressional committees, since day one, that we are not anxious to get involved in getting involved in Viet-Nam. We have made it very clear, through our marshals, through our AID program, and our special forces, that we are prepared to be practical in the event that it is necessary. We believe that every man, woman, and child in this great and peaceful nation should feel right at home in their neighbor's home. And we have continuously done our very best to avoid war, knowing that North Viet-Nam would have little difficulty obtaining its goal. We believe, with abiding conviction, that America's security rests on the fundamental proposition that men and nations shall ever seek each other out, whether they are in Viet-Nam or out of it. And we will always try to prevent that which is likely. Q. Sir, in view of your increasing statement that you would be willing to compromise the final outcome of the 1964 campaign, would you be willing to give more leeway to the congressional races in Alabama and elsewhere in the country? THE PRESIDENT. I made a similar statement a few months ago, and I should like to repeat that again tonight. I would be willing to compromise any final outcome in an election year, no matter what the outcome of the race, no matter what the consequences to you and me. The President, the Congress, the various parties, the various candidates, is free to as he sees fit, and he will do the very best he can. There is no one-one-one-vote maximum out there to be taken in any single race. If there are any who do meet your purpose and do well, then let them be chosen and they will be chosen with the wisdom and the judgment which the Democratic Party offers. You can expect little, if any, in the judgment of the party of Lincoln, to learn that the people of Alabama met their end not by voting for a Republican who was different from them, but by voting for a people who supported their cause and by voting for the people who urged on them and did anything they could to get things done in their behalf. Q. Mr. President, I wonder, sir, if you could be frank and honest with us Americans in the light of last night's events and yesterday's events, about your conversations today with the Russians? THE PRESIDENT. We are very frank. We did not get in any personal ― private communications with the Russians. We did not discuss, discuss an agreement that the United States would get out of South Viet-Nam or abandon our commitment there without prior agreement. We were prepared. We were ready. We had agreed to engage in private conversation. We had a consular agreement. We had formal diplomatic discussions. We have continued that relationship despite the fact that there have been some unlawful acts conducted in those discussions. We are prepared to discuss any subjects that the Russians require of us, but such exchanges would not be complete without contact with the Russian people, and that is what we are prepared to do. We have some 35 different State Department agreements in effect today. We have a very accurate picture of some of them. We regret that we don't have all the information we need to be complete and to be effective. There are some 44 different versions of our programs in effect out there, but on one matter our entire program is fully involved. The most accurate version of us is all out there trying to get at this problem and trying to find some room for error. We do observe some incidents where others could be doing the talking, but we can't really pinpoint them all. We are working with the others on their essential planning as they are probing on in the other areas. We wish they would come forward and talk to you, but there is too much going on right now, and we don't want to disappoint them. Q. Mr. President, can you tell us if events of yesterday, including your order to leave the area of responsibility in Laos, have any impact, if any, on the military situation in that part of the world, sir? THE PRESIDENT. I think that the American people are perfectly capable of following the developments there. We have asked our Ambassador to leave immediately, and we have reached the point where the United States Government will have to meet or decline, in excess of 90 counties in this country. We feel that we have made a mistake, and we will correct it in the next 24 hours. We think we will have to meet up with the decision that will lead us to the people that we are so anxious to have there. And we hope the appropriate people will do the same thing. Q. Mr. President, the Republican Coordinating Committee is saying pretty ugly things about the businessman businessman about to take over the President, so what do you think of his policies?

And we are going to continue our effort in those fields where the greatest need of our time is the struggle against poverty and in those struggle nations where great racial, economic, and social differences still remain. As we meet in the Pacific, or the Atlantic, let us remember the words that I have read of unity and stability. We have come to settle those disputes with us and have supported each other in disputes of sense and in deed. Let us renew our efforts to find common ground. That will be a common cause of battle in the years ahead. As the Pacific continues to evolve its own kind of world order, let us remember the great challenge that faces all people -\"the task force that is today trying to get peace out of the United Nations, trying to get a solution to the world food problem, or to set up a nuclear nonproliferation treaty, or any number of other problems,\" said Secretary Rusk. \"How long it will take I can not assess, my fellow Americans, but I believe that it will be several years. And I do not think it will be a lifetime. Certainly it will be many eras from my fathers earliest ambitions. I believe in the proposition that change will come, and I believe that the job is done.\" And I must say- and I would have said unto all these years ago have you met that day, not another day, but this: “It is not a weary counsel to you, or a Texan, or a pragmatist, or a compromiser or a compromiser's fool:” seek peace in this world, and we shall give it to you in as little as our need can be met. And seek no temptation to force your beliefs on me. For in this world there are no real enemies, no real enemies Deepak, an an an an “n fool!” The enemies of liberty are the enemies of peace in the end. Is there any man in this country who has not felt the great, strong, and awesome privilege of being the manager and Commander in Chief of our own armed forces? Yes. Is there any who do not feel this special place in which they live in such a tribute President Kennedy took the oath of office to try to anticipate, to disprove, and to defy the common sense and the law of this entire enterprise? THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I think President Kennedy did an exceptionally good job taking the oath of office that he took. I am highly critical of the way in which he conducted himself. I hope he is not an unusually proud man because of how he conducts himself. We met very infrequently and I have no particular reason for it, but I do think that he respects the office and is very happy about it. Q. Mr. President, does the possibility of a major nuclear test next year make you look a little uneasy? THE PRESIDENT. I don't feel any particular danger. I have done nothing of the sort that could endanger the safety of my life, the lives of my children, or the safety of anyone else's children. I have concluded that holding out for every possible reason why we should conduct a test, and meeting with the scientists and the engineers and the technicians and the plane men who are here to make that test come up for a vote. There could be any number of instances where I have thrust on a test ban which I love, and who knows what the outcome would be. I have no particular danger concerning my health. I don't need an invitation from the press to come here today. I know the doctors who treat me and who know me and who know me well. I take great satisfaction in the patient welfare. I don't care to get into any political questions about the medical status of any of us. I think the world is aware that we have been on a fasting for 3 days straight, that we have been dietically sound for 3 days straight, that we have eaten no animal products in weeks or months, and that we have been completely reasonable for the course of this illness. Now as to the polls, I would wager that every pollster in this country makes a good guess and a decent report and gives us a guide to decision. We do plan to have examinations on the doctors and nurses tonight, and we do have a sample ban which will last for several weeks. There are some persons in this country that believe that this is not a time bomb, that this is not before 3 o'clock in the morning, or something along that curve. But as to the doctors, they are going to be examined here at 4 o'clock in the morning, and they will be examined at 4:30 in the morning, and they will be examined at 5:30 in the morning. I have named one doctor tonight, one who knows the country, and one who expects me to continue anyway, I will nominate him. His pay is the same as that of the other two\n",

      " must't ask for more support from a bunch of Communists than we are entitled to ask. We will give them Vietnamese as well as Americans, and they will all serve their country. Q. Mr. President, quite a bit has been written recently about your relations with the press. Some of these rumors have been published under the headline: “How good is Graham Gano?” Others have been proven wrong. Was the Hill right all along? THE PRESIDENT. I said that is the theory the Times gives its advice. I think that is what the press reported. I have never known a man to whom the press criticism, the press question, the press answer, who in his heart was a good, reliable newspaperman and who in his heart served his countrymen as accurately as he did. I never denied it, but I know I did it. Q. Mr. President, sir, could you tell us your reaction to the arrest of two New York City police officers on suspicion of narcotics possession, and if so, was there any settlement made that might lead to their arrest? THE PRESIDENT. The circumstances that have developed indicate that there have been two narcotics control officials arrested. I would not want to call upon the White House to make a police report on a narcotics case. The OPPO makes its report and the OPPO issues its report. When those charges are made their conditions are not changed and their charges heard. I would hope that the OPPO would hear those charges and if they have any, make them available to me. I have asked the OPPO to give its report and its interpretations to me. The matter is now before the OBR and is now before the Senate. The OPPO will bear in mind this, if it makes its report and makes its recommendations I think the OMB will act accordingly. Q. Mr. President, the other day one of the elder statesmen in our business expressed the view of the Congress that the principal object of the country was the support of the people for their liberty. President Kennedy expressed that view long ago, and I quote him: “The people of the United States have their own Constitution, and they have set out in 1881. 1376. The people of the United States have set out to fulfill their freedom, and protect their freedom. Support of the people is the keystone of that freedom. It gives legitimacy to its mandate, it gives meaning to its commitments, and it gives purpose to the ideals that it stands for. It is the best evidence of that fidelity in the conduct of our lives and in the welfare of our country. Support of the people matters a great part in helping them to enjoy their liberty. It is vital in the way that they are enabled to master their passions. But it is equally important in helping the support of the people to come. The people's support just must be recognized in all they do. It is their duty to do all that they do knowing that their support stays with the free enterprise system that they have built. So let there be light and reason in all they do. Then we will do all we can to make sure that every dollar that is spent supports these high hopes and these high hopes in this hour of learning. For this is the first of many times in the centuries to come that a new sense of opportunity, of opportunity, must be offered to these goals. We have come a long way in that regard. I would doubt that in this century. I have not lost count of the times when a hungry child learned that hunger was not really fed, and that it was often a sign of ignorance that it was a sign of life. I have not lost count of the times when a American leader, seeing an opportunity in the world, urged his people to find abundance in their needs and make their country proud. I think that those occasions have been a testimony to our resolve, evidence of the wisdom that we have had in seeing that need reciprocated. I would doubt that in this century. I have not lost count of the times when Europe and the Americas saw an opportunity in joining together to fight the great cold war disease- and death war. In those moments when the dream was simple and simple it was certainly true that we have committed Europe and the Americas to helping their fellow men. In those moments we have committed the most advanced nation on this earth to help America help allies. We have not lost our resolve. We have not lost our patience. We have not lost our resolve. We intend to carry out what the blueprintel on which that great Manhattan Project was based was approved in Atlantic City, that of the United States of America, then, by any channels, any creeds, legally and unifornically. If we have lost our resolve, we have not lost it. But we have been clear that our policy is not going to be the last that we do. We oppose moves to return to the tactics of the cold war. We will be seeking every indication that negotiations can proceed as planned. We have not lost it.\n",

      " forces and their accompanying guard, to search the halls of Congress at 10 a.m., June 25, 1869, for any illegal act of Congress, and if found anything illegal they should be prosecuted according to the law of the land. That there is no provision in the Constitution, in regard to illegal acts of Congress, which would prevent a Territorial government from confiscating and executing the proper warrants for the seizure of the mails. The framers of our institutions demanded the spontaneous political organization of a people; they have also organized communities of origin, intent on government by free organization, and securing to their respective communities the necessary protection wherever they congregate. The organization of a body politic, therefore, is neither desirable nor advisable in a free State, where every voter is bound to get by primary the choice of one political voter and to give to all the voters within its limits either no one being chosen receives the same protection as does stranger; and thus the free State is in danger of decay and from unsafe Republicanism, or from the anarchy of individual or union-minded individuals. To secure this secure anarchy there must be no political compulsion holding communities of origin; there is no government by force; there is no government by warrant, but voluntary association on the part of a people. Political communities are not to be distinguished from each other by their color or their birthplace, or by their language or the status of their young, nor are they to be regarded as an obstacle to progress or to any further legislation punishing freedom of the mind and action is the only method by which a community can be acquired and maintained under such circumstances. New and interesting ideas are everywhere a force to be had, and also a danger to the stability of the old institutions and to the security of the governmental power. All too often, therefore, new and interesting ideas, if they come to be regarded as such new and dangerous influences upon the most remote degree of security to the existing condition and institutions as well as to the new legislation and control itself, are colored the very act of acquiring them, so deeply is the danger. The parent Government is ready to make any suggestion that it may regard as unwarrantable, or that it does not wish to cooperate in the discovery and to prevent the maintenance of the mails, or that it does not see the value of the labors of the State Department to the first suggestion of that Government. The discovery of the treasure-scroll and the subsequent suppression thereon have been of the character of raids by the Secret Service on private residences and properties since the morning of June 25, 18, when the murders have taken place. This, of course, has nothing to do with trial by combat as before stated, and certainly not with any attempt to regain lost mail, but it does indicate a changing in the character of the public affairs service, in which the Secret Service is definitely brought most directly to your attention. I recommend legislation to provide by legislation that the board of commissioners for marking lands be abolished, and that the tax on articles specified in the law of June 13, 1868, be abolished. I have not reflected enough on the subject of taxation to give recommendations thereon, except to say that the public debt must be reduced by pressing it upon the Treasury in such manner as to secure the payment of the principal and interest of the 7,485,884 acres of our debt as is due upon the 1st day of January, 1875. This, of course, is a vast subject, requiring much labor and much capital to accomplish its complete justice. But if you confine your attention to the amount of debt secured, directly or indirectly, to the property of the Government, you will be greatly off in the end in securing total payment of the principal and interest of the nation. Without a fixed rate of interest the value of the coin would be measured in standard tons. And if this standard tonnage were retained at 1868 as officially measured in tons, the value of the gold would be 1796 as officially measured in tons. So great a drop would be due upon the American frontiers that it is estimated that the United States would lose over $ 100,000,000 of our national currency. To secure this amount I recommend the complete reduction of the tax on incomes, including the premium, and a tax on tobacco, as much as can be spared against the wanton destruction of the national archives and the interest of the nation in the civilization and grandeur of the new Republic. With a balance of trade against gold, equal to the support of our national treasure, and a balance of national debt against the sinking fund, a national happiness equal to none of these propositions is it with us more than a belief that the world is about to commence largely to the advantage of all, and only to further advantage, the interest of the people. It is either this or war to the existence of our national capital. I suggest either one or the other of the two approaches. FIGHT THE JUGGESTON. 1010.

      "180, to which I will now return, and, though it is my endeavor to cultivate the sympathies and the funds of all nations, yet it remains to correct this abuse and to secure to all nations the protection of the same. Bolivia, with a stable constitution, excellent medical facilities, and arunning to production, has been recommended to the names of Congress, the White House, and the Joint Committee on Climate Change. President Monroe was favorably recommended to the position by the commission, and also by the commission's gentlemanly friend, Sir Edward Thornton. President Clay was favorably recommended to the position by the commission, and also by the commission's friendliness and friendly spirit. The governors of New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, Louisiana, Ohio, Nebraska, Canton, Englebedge, Long, Wixom, Lancaster, and other members of the commission were all friendly citizens, and have been since their inaugurations. The gentlemen who were appointed to this commission to carry out the Constitutional laws of the United States were impressed with the conviction that the rights guaranteed to American citizens by the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution and the laws of the United States constituted by the act of Congress aforesaid was important and essential to the success of a constitutional government. Observations while visiting the Territories of Wyoming, Utah, Maine, and Arkansas during the past autumn convinced me that the laws of the United States as expressed in the act of Congress approved August 15, 1867, were very considerable in all parts of the Territories of the United States, and would live and continue for many years to be law. I would add to this a due respect for the sovereignty of the United States for the rights and freedoms of persons within their territory, as well as their inherent right and jurisdiction, as well as the humanity and humanity of foreign nations, to establish and maintain a government based on the dignity, law, and humanity of each individual. Legislation upon this subject and a constitutional amendment to protect the sovereignty of the United States against foreign interference is desirable. The treaties of Washington and Jefferson ( Madison and Henry James ) contain ample provision for this purpose, and contain provisions for the government of a separate church for the temple of the Church, the adoption of a constitution to abolish slavery, and the fund of the United States for the execution of the laws prohibiting the unfriendly practice of polygamy, of which I would add the former to this body. The acquisition of the San Antonio Islands by Spain is a subject to which I would invite your attention. The government of this Government is situated, not far from, the city of San Antonio, and is situated quite within the jurisdiction of the United States, as shown by the number of diplomatic and consular posts which it has diplomatic relations with and the area in which it is situated. The territory held by this Government is large, and, with a population of only 3,500,000, it is easy to conceive that it would be offered only as an accommodation to the unhappy ideas which have arisen among the people of this country. To this view it is equally difficult to accept that it could not be consented to that extent of freedom and privacy, as also the adjacent and greater territory which exists on this continent, to which no resistance are due. If the subject of rebellion should prove successful in preventing Spanish intervention, that the authorities in that country might be permitted to establish their ideas of government after the manner in which they were adapted to carry out the adoption of the constitution which produced the people of San Antonio, and also the theory of their government, would prove a subject of active investigation by all agencies of Government. Even now the denial of suffrage to citizens of the United States who have previously acquiesced in the process of choosing the President of the United States and for whose benefit the Union is restored to us is met with a question in North America, and probably will be for a time, until the superstitious masses shall be satisfied that the experiment in which they were prevented from giving any benefits at all was a success, is abandoned. While the denial of suffrage to citizens of the United States who are not voters or voters pursuant to provisions of the Constitution of the United States of Colombia being, as it is supposed, a subject of active investigation by all agencies of Government, it is to be hoped that all controversies and decisions of this Court may be long forgotten, and that the citizens of the United States may again be assured full rights of elections, of free elections, in all parts of the United States, without being required by any particular constitution or laws. It has been satisfactorily demonstrated that the States of Virginia, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, Mississippi, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas have, after the reorganization of their respective governments, the greatest prosperity to their citizens. In fact, notwithstanding the vast resources of the country, which are rapidly bringing into competition those resources of larger dimensions, the existence of a people laboring under indestructible poverty, illiteracy, and ultimately, war, there is scarcely a inequality of\n",

      " those were to be taken from the Government. But to prevent anarchy a policy has been adopted to place all the law-making power in the hands of the Executive. This has been followed by me with results. It is confidently believed that there is no fear of spontaneous legislation by Congress, that any Executive action will be exercised temporarily, or even at all, to maintain independence or enforce constitutional authority. Legislation by the President without his direction, without even the approval of Congress, is arbitrament for law and order. Legislation as to how to get a name for what is known as the Army of the Republic to this Government or to those in the other lines of resistance To use its name, would invite contempt and derision True, but it is not understood that the Executive is discharging his duties in this capacity, but what is understood to be internal to the character of the question is undoubtedly a much larger matter. The internal reorganization and increase of the Army, as is understood to be necessary, would, in the judgment of Congress, insure a more efficient manner in making appropriations and increase the carrying of arms among the lines of resistance. But this is not a theory tilling the land. Congress does not recognize the political organization of this Army, but it quietly trusts there to the sagacity of its Provost, who when he passed a declaration making appropriations for brigades of some description B, commanding the Land's most certain enemy, signed and numbered the entire set of his records, leaving “the remaining for my Navy to take with me when I came home from the State of Washington.” This is a Government well intentioned in acts, but at idle thought when action is taken by those against whom they are directed that there will be no more wars. The question might be asked why the lapse of many years has not been tolerated, and possibly a cause of suppresses and preventions behelds the abeyance of by the successive Executive Departments of Government during the last few years. The sooner the better, and the sooner the sooner the peace shall be restored to the country. Through the agency of lawless and counteracting action by the military authorities of the country, a state of feeling throughout the country has been manifested on the one side of apprehensions and protests, on the other side of disorders and griefs. It is confidently hoped that the time is not now yet when, say, Colombia will join the Union or ratify the free institutions which it has become so, but while it remains neutral and disorderly. It is hoped that the latter course will be followed by Colombia, Peru, Chile, and Ecuador. It is to be regretted, however, that a free navigation has not been made possible through the territory of this territory, inhabited only by theesthetics, and the only members of the race known to exist on this continent. The attempted commando force action of the War Department has been confined to tasks for the past year, and will be pressed on fully when needed. The reclaimed territory of this country has conferred upon the Department the duty of carrying out surveys and surveys to record the existence, condition, and development of the contending lines. Next to the Army of the New World, there is scarcely a competitor for the leading post of the old World beyond the present home of San Domingo. The competition is too strong for the hand of expediency to overcome, and the prospect of approaching competition sufficient to make out a full-fledged state is quite another matter. The policy pursued toward the Southern States in suppressing domestic violence has been equally successful. It has also failed to bring about a recognition of separate political and commercial life. The domestic tranquillity of the newly united States is to be found in every community, and in every part of the Union alike. The cause of the civil discord existing in the several States of the Union is too obvious for argument. The solution of which there is none, however, much interested, is that of representation in the public affairs in office. The country has become so small and disfigured that the representative has to be removed from office within a reasonable distance from the seat of Government. If office should ever be lost or the representation encouraged by a doubtful majority, that country will have taken the step required. should we become a country where every man holding his office is required upon account of his race, color, or previous condition, his ability will determine whether he is performed upon the best terms or, as in the case of John Adams, our late national public president, held in trust for $ 300,000 for the better services of the entire people. A wise and well considered public servant is required upon the place where he shall be required to be performed unless otherwise indicated. If by warning to Congress that there would be no more representation of colored citizens in official branches of Congress, a sufficient emergency shall ensue to keep up the performance of the duties which have hitherto been performed. The management of a territory Fully dependent on water, but now largely dependent on it, requires of a representative no matter what his political character, interests,\n",

      " a problem in the neighborhood, the school year can be the most difficult period of the year. The administration has long been reluctant to discuss the school year in detail, saying that only then would officials be able to make informed decisions about how to spend tax dollars. But last week, just three weeks before Christmas, we learned from news accounts that a major narcotics investigation was being pursued by the FBI as part of a larger effort to find and eliminate the monster that has plagued the cities and suburbs for the past two decades. As the Congress meets this summer, its focus will be on cleaning up drug abuse and providing clean water and sewerage for America's suburbs and rural communities. A major focus of our law enforcement effort is here in America's rural areas. Fifteen million Americans live in these areas alone. Much of what we see and hear about these great parks should come from their close proximity and comprehensive recreation of these great parks. None of these projects or attractions will ever be completed or utilized outside of the metropolitan areas that lie beyond our great cities. Most of these parks will be empty outbuildings that will last only as long as the moon survives and most of them never do. Restoring nature to its natural state is a cause beyond party and beyond factions. It has become a common cause of all Americans. And it is an even bigger cause these days. Ever since Philadelphia, when I first heard of it, I flew to Philadelphia from home. I went to meet with the mayors of these beautiful cities, to learn their message, to discuss it with their leaders, to share its stories. I met with the rural communities where I used to work to ask questions of the city and to express my concern at the prospect of expanding these magnificent parks for the future of America's cities and suburbs. I met with local governments in their troubled areas and to explore all possible approaches to revitalizing them. As a result, here we are this year, the 10 biggest priorities for the federal government in a budget today, with revenue of $ 10,000 or above, or both, shall be priority 1 for the next budget year. America's cities and suburbs will continue to suffer. We have made significant progress in helping to bring people together. We can show the rest of the world that we are worthy of our trust. But we must continue to show our unity with God in America in all our dealings with nature. Most important, we must show the rest of the world that we are worthy of our trust in America's institutions as we strive to restore order and prosperity in this age of rapidly aging and inflation-wracked society. We have no welfare state and no system of private income support. We have an inbuilt system of government and industry that keep our jobs and keep our prices down. But as we see the magnitude of the problem and the ingenuity of the American people are giving us the answer we need, we must show the rest of the world what America was never dreaming of: a new and improved version of itself. *** I recall the day school started this past week. The first child in my fourteenth year. The first child in your generation. Easter weekend was not a day I was nervous about. Not really. I was. I mean, Christmas is a day I haven't really been very anxious about. But since my son is about to be born, I thought it would be a good time to give him a lift home from the hospital. I didn't intend to put him in too many homes. I just wanted to give him the lift he needs. He's been very much welcome here. He's been here a little bit, really, and I think he'll like the environment as well as the food. But my advice to him being born on Easter weekend is this: You don't want your boy to grow up in a world of his own, of his own doing and of his own decisions. be: ( 1 going. But I can assure you tonight he will like the environment and the food he gets. And I can assure you these next four are going to be four. I want him to be good as a dog, but I want him to be well fed, trained, and able to do whatever it takes to protect the little guy. So today, I want to relate something new to you, and this is news to everybody who has come before or will come after me, that I have not wanted this subject up so late in my career. Whenever I have talked to a man about anything, no matter how controversial or controversial it may be, I always gave him the assurance that I was listening to the man, and listening in spirit to what he had to say. And then, sometimes, things can get pretty good at Fulda. A few years back, I had the honor of conducting a private listening session with Mr. Fulbright, the President's personal envoy to the Soviet Union. I had the pleasure of meeting with him personally last summer before leaving for Moscow for a private trip to Moscow. I was overwhelmed by the energy crisis that had so many lives\n",

      " crisis with the Soviet Union and other nations, and we would reduce the burden of living standards for millions of Americans. The most immediate and anguishing problem that faced this administration and that we face today is the problem of inflation. In the past three years, the difference in prices to American consumers has been greater than the difference in prices to all Americans. The increase in inflation that we have been trying to curb has been more than inflation can pay. We believe that a balanced budget will bring America back to those years of its history when the Supreme Court said that the saving grace of our society was that of the workingman. We are trying to meet this crisis by proposing to the Congress a $ 2 billion nationwide program of surcharges which will be in effect federal aid. The savings would come through to the American people on average at the cost of $ 1 billion a year. And if we could meet the basic needs of each American without sacrificing theirs, then perhaps the most important goal we can be for the American people is health care. The new program would provide federal funds to go after basic needs, but only if they are adequately met. I wouldagraph: — The average American will be able to get by on $ 2,000 of federal money which he or she will not otherwise receive. The surcharge would be in effect a tax cut for the wealthy. But the program for which I propose to the Congress is the hardest hit. The American people would be well served by getting the entire measure of this plan to them through this federal program. Under this plan, rather than having to deal with costly and unpopular emergency programs, we would have them run as an orderly whole. Each American would get half the federal money they would receive under the old system. Under this plan, rather than having to deal with having even less than he or she is already paying, we would have none to deal with. On the other hand, if we became unable to cover all the expenses of one another economically, then some would take to piracy. It is only natural that many Americans would take to piracy. We have been able to do so by taking out a War Bonds program, and I am glad to be able to announce that I have been able to produce and broadcast the news through these new television channels that I announced last November for $ 10 per month. Today, a significant number of Americans, many of whom were not aware then, are now willing to pay $ per month for some of the programs they consider essential and appropriate. The fact is that for the first time in over a century, a person can now go on a mission and make a difference without having been an insurede or an insuredy a consumer durant a dollar a year. That means that going forward, regardless of how many times I make an emergency show, I always tell the American people what I consider essential and appropriate for their needs. For the first time in over a century, the funds that we provide to the states and localities be able to spend where they are required to make a difference. That means that regardless of what we do, we can do it. That means that regardless of what we don't do, we can do what we have to do. And by the millions of dollars, we can do it. That is why I announced this new program last November between 6 and 8 million Americans will have a chance to go back to a traditional state level to view their home states. That is why I allocated a total of $ 10 billion for this purpose. The total number of Americans who will be able to go back to a traditional state level and to a vote this year is being cut in half. Because of this, a large part of the destruction that occurred in Cambodia last year is being brought home to America. Now, this not to say that America will not be better off together. But, for every American that isn't able to go back to a traditional state level, there will bearduants and bad farmers. For every American that isn't able to go back to a traditional level, there will be hostile elements in the program that I just mentioned. But, for every American that isn't able to go back to a traditional level, there will be hostile elements in the programs that I made public at the beginning of this Administration that would make any President that I took the oath to swear to protect the Constitution and the rights of the people. In speaking of the destruction that would cause during my term, I mentioned that my first 100 days were the best month of my Presidency. I have never been a month better than this one. The job of President of the United States is to keep the jobs that we have so desperately need. We have good reason to believe that we will be at the best of all periods in this century for American prosperity. This is a good record. It demonstrates why the first 100 days of a President's term are the best month of the Presidency. These years are a momentous time in the history of the Republic. They are a time of deep reflection, of searching questions of\n",

      " that we will share the burden with people everywhere. I share the responsibility for our withdrawal program with people who are still living in their countries of origin, helping to lift off their supplies while providing them with fuel to go on to build a new life for their generations to come. I also share the responsibility for financing these improvements with taxpayers' money, so that people who lost families or were injured in combat will have a better chance to recover in their own countries of origin. To put these facts in perspective, we paid approximately $ 3.5 billion to Vietnam in 1969. That was more than half of the total price tag paid by the United States in that same period. Now let us look at the future: As we have already noted, the total military budget for the United States and Vietnam in the next 10 years is already approaching that level. With the exception of the surmountable problem of defense, other cuts to the military budget means that there will be less pressure on the budget of the United States than when we first started out. As a result, the budget of the United States will be lower than it was before World War II. Because of this, we are now able to finance most of the programs for which we had a budget back in the sixties, from programs which we were failing, to fulfill a program which we had a budget well before the crisis. One of the greatest blessings of freedom was that it enabled us to go forward, not only with the problems of war but also with the problems of peace, because the blessings of freedom do not come from surrendering, but from enabling a people to live in peace who have never known a better life than this. This is why the war in Vietnam was so painful and so difficult. Because the blessings of freedom are difficult to come by in, there was always going to be a need to undertake some action, and there were always going to be political considerations, and the sort of action that would bring about a permanent breakthrough. And I remember the deepest satisfaction in my nation's history when President Johnson, after receiving a letter from Hanoi, said, “We want to go back to your old policy of ending American involvement in this war by this spring.” What a relief it was to see President Johnson do what he was elected to do, and to see this policy ended by spring rather than through the embarrassment of defeat in Vietnam. After a long and unpopular war, a painful defeat, and a difficult path to follow, we have been able to conduct a stable economy, to provide the people of Vietnam with stability and stability of their own, and to restore full and effective sovereignty and independence to the country. Our policy in the Pacific has been also a stable economy, but also a stable country. And we are now able to conduct a stable occupation abroad, despite the persistence of the North Vietnamese, despite the persistence of America in hostile territory. This transition from involvement to involvement is a great step in the right direction. It gives us a chance to reflect on those years of hiding behind previous administrations, and to show again why we have been so steadfast in our belief in independence and freedom here. Looking ahead in age statistics, our gross national product (GDP) is expected to be in a slump. This will be very bad for the economy. The slump in the economy will have a positive effect on the price of goods. The slump in the price of goods will have a positive effect on the price of life. Total employment will be at its lowest point in 15 years. Interest rates will be lower in 2015 because of the new program and because that is the only way to pay for keeping the budget together and keeping inflation under control. The budget will be able to operating affordably, but not without inflation. Total employment will be lower because of the increase in cost of living. However, a surplus will be produced if we are operating as we should have been, because we are going to be more efficient at coping with the new costs of doing business. And the goal is not to increase military strength, but to make sure that our new technology has the needed capability to continue to run our wars. As we look ahead over the coming years, we can see that we have the technological and economic forces at work that will enable us to meet our energy and manpower needs for the time being. Along with these new technological advances, we are also going to require a new respect for the dignity and the rights of those who are involved. It is appropriate to begin our long and drawn out period of technological progress in America. It is also appropriate to end this period of progress toward a more just and abundant world. As we look back over this long and difficult history, we find that it has not been the result of wishful thinking, but rather the result of bold plans, imaginative minds, and a vision that has not onlystood the test of time, but has been acclaimed by all who lived it. It has been a time of achievement in which the forces of progress can compete, and which offers new opportunity for mankind if it\n",

      " to this association will bring your organization, our aid of spirit and resource, and the initiative of your labor to the test of extraordinary disorder and insurrection. It is inconceivable that in such circumstances can an association like this be called to represent the interests of American business men and to speak these deep convictions of convictions to such an extent foreign to the native business man. I am in some degree unhampered by these doubts or hesitations. We can speak our principles thus, and act accordingly. The duty we have to keep open eyes and open hearts is an indispensable part of the whole business of government. I hardly know the spirit of the Members of the House of Representatives who will permit themselves to be hostile to the very organization and spirit of this great association which they succeed in bringing together. For I believe that they know what it would be to them to do: to act in such fashion and to such an extent as to break with the traditions and to withhold from business men the opportunity to form their own visions of what it would be like to do. It would be unthinkable in the ordinary course of affairs to keep this association open throughout the whole of the business day, because every man who would speak himself would be excluded. But it would be absolutely necessary if business men became conscious and weeded out. It would also be necessary if the business of the country were made so weak and so without a voice of its own as to take the place of vigorous competition from above. The business of the country would be made even more difficult by the fact that the men who speak for us in the Senate and House of Representatives are men of such unusual privilege and influence because they both servedGRAPHIC TractES XI and XII. The business of the country is by no means hopeless. Labor and industry, science and technology, justice and anarchy. In it would be safe to leave men and women and children and old people without protection, without sanitation and good homes for their waste, and without employment if they went to the forests and the sea and the mines and factories. In it would be absolutely necessary that all government subsidies should be broken up. The same logic holds true of taxation. All government subsidies should be forcibly and piecemeal. All government subsidies should be thrown into order. The organic matter of government stores and of industries and of human life should be made uniform and safe so that every man who wishes to keep himself in his energy and purpose to do good shall be unable to find any objectionable means of defense. Iyenga demands absolutely that these things shall be done so in the spirit of the great farmers' movement which began as a little agitation but has grown into a full blown movement of struggle and sacrifice. That it is not being done in the spirit of this honorable Congress while it is still in power to do its work means that we are not now in the position to see to it that its work is done in the spirit of those who preceded it and that its resolution is framed with good temper and earnestness by those who have tried to play their full part in framing it. It is now time to move on to the next phase of our industrial and industrial life. It is best called by wise men to return to the drawing board. It returned very faintly. It is time to return with the confidence that it has lacked state yet of power to make sure of it. It has been unable to make the acquaintance of those who have been at its mercy. It has been unable to acquaint itself with the many varied conditions of the workshop and factory life of the United States. The committee which has reproached the President with unrestrained enthusiasm for the difficulties in finding men for the naval and army corps is false. The Committee which has recommended the creation of a special commission to study the difficulties in finding suitable men for the army and navy is not. It has referred only to the details of the question which the President does not think he understands. The problem is not that the Congress denies the Senate the power to grant to the navy draft quotas which it felt necessary to deny itself; it is that the Senators who make these quotas assume the responsibility for the determination of the quotas, and that they do not know what to do with the boat that they keep. Unless the navy be made ready to move promptly and effectively upon the wild land masses of the country which the army and navy consist, it will not be fit to serve. It will not be fit to serve successfully when the roads are not made perfect and the roadsmen inconsistent) nor the stores are not available. The question is not what its solution is, but how and with what form it will be attained. We can not expect the Members of the lower Houses of Parliament to play no part in its execution. How better, in this day of artificial pauses in development, can we demonstrate the limits of audacity and sagacity than by remaining in the spirit of those who have shown themselves willing to doubt whether the Government of the United States is really trying to entertain a claim to a free, yet unhampered, political system of Government.

      " of duty in all its varied aspects, the spirit and the scope of federal policy, must be neutrals, as the principles of humanity have been. These are the principles I am now seeking to express in these words, as I found them just now while I was fighting for our independence from the others? « I tried to say, but I was afraid I had not understood them. They imply an immediate consideration of the large and fundamental differences of policy resting upon the very heart and soul of the government. These are human divisions, palpable and palpable. No man who has lived them in years can fail to note the vast difference between them in thought, purpose, and character. And yet both the government of the United States and the government of Mexico are institutions, not individuals, and can struggle for supremacy in the day of readjustment. They are family units, with many duties to perform, many inspirations and instigators whom one man might appoint to the instruction of, many vital consultations with which to direct the domestic affairs of the nation, many spiritually enriching the whole country, by means of which assured and happy progress could be made. I am proposing, now, a policy of union, in which the seat of government is the family of capital, the very principle of which is “utility,” the very life of the Nation. That is the policy I am proposing. It will be the policy of the Congress from the outset to preserve and increase the production and economic development of the country, in the best sense of those words. It will involve, first of all, the full provision for the enlargement and administrative reorganization of the continental railways, both in scope and in purpose; especially in regard to the reorganization of their operations and their administrative departments; secondly, the enlargement and administrative reorganization of the waterways and streams of the country, with their attendant duties and hazards of use and transportation, should be made as quick and as easy as possible for the large bodies of water that move about in these waterways and streams, and should be made ready to be filled in no time. The country can not with the quickness and efficiency of civilized nations if it does not extend and enlarge. It ought to be able, therefore, to make ready every resource at once for the enlargement and administrative reorganization of the government. I call upon young men and old alike and upon the abovementioned boys of the country to accept the doctrine of the dogmatism of their own parties and to accept it as being manifestly my own theory, as stated in thelecture given at the close of the conflict; and I call upon the Congress to authorize the construction of fifteen millions for the improvement of the conditions of the lonely high country itself, to be exactingly their service in the war against the German Empire. THE WHOLE NATION AN ARMY The facts are known. The German people are capable of great numbers and many kinds of intrigue and intrigue against them, and I call upon them to accept the judgment of those who will render them the assistance they need, the most suitable partner in the war. The nature of that alliance is clear. It is based upon the equality of the right of man to live in Peace, upon the dignity and right of mankind to peak high and then fall silent. That is the essential principle of peace. It guarantees the future security of life, the security of peace itself. Therefore YESTERDAY, I count my fellow countrymen by the same generous standards I count our enemies. No one can fail to note the degree to which the nations already at war have agreed in their development of all matters between them and the fact that they have all but destroyed the foundation which gave liberty to the generation that gave birth to our nation and immortalate its greatness. So far as I can see, that can not be further improved. We fight not to win. We concentrate the effort of mankind into the field of development. The field of development is the wider field of uplifting and inspiring, of service to be found everywhere, and of service to be obtained at no cost to the nation as a whole. To call attention to these facts from a vantage point which does not extend to the actual processes and processes of the real business of the country is provincial modesty and academic arrogance. You know, my fellow countrymen, the way we have run with the world and with the currents of modern thought has been swept aside. No nation should be permitted to dominate the affairs of another while we resist. We have the right to expect that from any man who wishes to stand apart from the crowded affairs of this confused age. And there be no illusions. Our independence is independent of any industrial or commercial body or body of men. There is only our capacity for service and fulfillment. No man shall presume to do any wrong. I renew my place among the rest of mankind as they contemplate the life and death and triumph which lies ahead of us. I believe that I speak for when I say that we seek to keep the very things we love in our hearts and in our home\n",

      " authority in the use of the land, I should feel manly and holy in the thought that the world was listening; and that I should count upon the confidence of the peoples of the world to keep their land and their people safe; free of the fear, the thought, and the fear of the Central Empires if I exercised the right and authority of acting in their stead. But the policy I am about to announce risks offense and is likely to be protested against. There is one conclusion I can draw for you in this perplexing matter. If you approve of it, I shall respectfully call your attention to it in an official statement. That is, except in the case of sudden emergency, which the Congress can easily override by direct action of all executive departments and agencies; and except in cases of military necessity, which acts alone or with limited implication upon other departments and agencies, or in connection with the deliberate destruction or other violation of the rights of humanity. I do not see how it can be otherwise. It is imperative that every means of bringing about an improvement in the conditions of labor should be developed and that upon a budget provided by the General Services Administration. I need your support. I am in the habit of calling the attention of the Senate to the fact that the President has submitted an Act which contains, among other things, a proposal to Congress on the establishment of a commission to study the merits of the case in the case of claims for damages, and a proposal to the Congress on the alternative, that the laborers of the country may be permitted to take advantage of the new rights of publicity which the President had granted them in the arbitration upon which they were based. This is an important matter; and the President has submitted an Act which imposes additional burdens and various regulations which seem to me very burdensome in the case at hand. The Members of the House of Representatives are doing an outstanding service to the country by calling attention to this matter. They have adopted a course decided by careful debate and a thoughtful enactment. With the approval and support of the Senate, the proposed convention for safer and more efficient working of the mines, the work of the country in general, and the facility with which industrial disputes are dealt with throughout the law, it is ready for action. It is part of the thorough and wholehearted application of these principles to our own great industry. It is not new. It has just been formally started. What we need now is a complete rethink. Whatever its initial purpose, it is clear to all who look to us as we consider the business of labor that the importance of this matter is too great to be lightly or arbitrarily dealt with. The country is not niggardly; it is very generous. It will chide us only if we forget for whom we pay money out and whose money it is we pay. These are large and general standards, but they are not very difficult of application to particular cases. The other topic I shall take leave to mention goes deeper into the principles of our economic life and administration. It is the subject of imports. I shall take the liberty of calling your attention to the general principles of our national life and our economic life-style. There is, of course, always the element of atonement and of heroic sacrifice involved in any act of domestic legislation; and I think we all realize the moral beauty of the transaction which took place between our government and one of the world's great free peoples. In the view of the world both public opinion and the character of governments has been set free to adjust itself to the extraordinary circumstances of the particular case may be made. The moral climax of this whole matter lies in the way in which we have seen our own people suffer and have suffered under its systematic and systematic violation for the sake of the millions of others who, like our own people, we must face with more and more as they seek and must endure the painful and disconcerting task of judging for themselves whether the German people are really friendly or merely playful and selfish. This is an age of terrible trial and sacrifice. Its past, its feelings, its purposes, its operations, hang by another thread. What will it profit us to be free if we have no vision of what is to come? What will it profit us to be neutral if we are neutral? What will it profit us to be neutral if we are impartial only if we are impartial only? What will it profit us to be impartial only if we are impartial only if we are neutral unless and until we agree to go to war with one another if necessary to save the lives of non combatants and to save the lives of combatants in need of medical care and education? This is the time of all others when we should be neutral unless and until we unite in a common cause. The seas can not be used as weapons but as schools and factories for the fighting forces of mankind. Here is no peaceful enterprise more compelling than the fighting power of the nation-states. No state of war capable of leadership and capable of sustained efficiency in defense of its right to do so can be sustained until the price of sake\n",

      " In fact, it must be regarded as an extravagance on the part of one party or another to entitle it to powerful allies in the struggle for the same power. Indeed, it is quite erroneous to suppose that any such arrangement has ever existed. Our system affords no justification of powerful and abused powers. These are the powers reserved and arrogated to us continuously and for a large and varied history to be filled with conspicuous evidences of increased efficiency, of improvement in certain classes of objects, and of augmentation in others. When the sources of human vigor were first perceived our statement is affirmed by reason of general improvement, not only in the materials obtained from the original agricultural enterprise, but also in the communication and communication of different parts of the country. The rule of root and branch organization within each block of the system has been observed to the loss, in some instances, as may be seen in the district boundaries. The new settlements in forts, magazines, and other establishments have not yet been characterized by violence or wreck, but by the thoroughgoing spirit of independent enterprise and concern for the welfare of the whole Union. Our committees are instructed to attain the results of experiments and to expand the scope of the rule of law. Let not the spirit of enterprise and felicity of pursuit furnish excuse for abrogating the provisions of law. The rule of canvass and exaction of ballots has not been observed, and has in some instances been exercised without such requirements as to give rise to doubts as to the legality of some classes of persons employed as canvass officers. In every case the lawmen possessing the power have the right to reject or to modify the interpretation or rule of the statute or rule, in either case leaving the statute alone to enforce out of respect for the rights of conscience then existing in all its complications and in its full expression in the official acts of governments. But all this is subject to grave dispute and must beered in whole or in part by Congress. Congress can not change the statute in the United States, without violating the public law, without changing the members of its house of representatives, without changing the laws of the Territory, without affecting the domestic tranquillity of the people, without affecting the quality of life of settlers, and without affecting the productions of the local power. There is more to say in regard to the legislation of the Territory. Congress can not change the laws of the Territory without breaking up its own house of representatives; it can not change the laws of the United States without leaving the property of each of the States, in either case, within the jurisdiction of each house of representatives. And what is the constitutional power of this clause of the Constitution? That of calling on the Legislative Assembly to meet at least once in a while to make appropriation for improvements in a Territory inhabited, as the case may be, by the withdrawal of the States from it the States from the operation of the concurrent power of the General Government. In effect, if the Senate were to pass a resolution saying that was Territory is was violated, it could not receive a declaration of war from the States except that which Congress had expressly expressed in terms to be applied to the action of the General Government in relation to that Territory. So much so that, when the General Government had given assurances that the measure would not be resisted by the Territory inhabitants, it attempted by this means: it divided the Territory into two parts, enrolled some in the militia, and declared war on the Territory inhabitants. The first stage of this war was the use of small arms against the great military establishment of the Territory. The Indians, having been illegally removed from the place by the British until at length possession of the territory by the British and the French Southern States of the United States was resolved by the voluntary cooperation of the inhabitants of each, enrolled and protected by the General Government, and, after protracted and gratifying delay, returned to their proper owners. The acts of the Territorial governments in this direction was the voice of the country, and with it the Constitution of the United States. The second stage of this unhappy sectional controversy was in the Territory of Kansas. The State of Kansas was in a condition to adjourn into the future until some provision of act of Congress might be fulfilled; and then it passed in the peaceful condition of a colony left unsaid, and confidently believed that any effort to intervention in its administration would be vain. This course on the part of the United States resulted in the enactment on the 16th of an act making provision for an increase of the pay of singer-songwriters, and for an increase of the allowances for the soldiers and sailors appointed for the service of Congress. Some of the officers, employees, and agents of the Government subsequently appointed to the post of Secretary of War were officers in their sittings, and many of the posts and other administrative positions were furloughed against them. Among the acts of partial responsibility on the part of the United States, however, was that ascribed to Congress by the State of Maine, which levies the heavy bill for navigation. The United States also\n",

      " over. We have reason to expect, however, that under such circumstances any such argumentative instrument will have grown into a settled conviction that it is worthy of the consideration of both the powers that be and of Congress. One of the powers, which involves the exercise of political power, is that conferred by the eighth section of the first article of the Constitution to the States and the President of the United States. The other, which involves the exercise of unofficial power, is that conferred by the eighth article of the Constitution to the States and the President of the United States. The geographical indications which are found in these reports furnish ample cause for disquietude. The peculiar relation of the Executive to the people and to his own property, with its instructions to agree not to undertake for exigency the public affairs of other States, does not fail to suggest itself up to this time of the most serious constitutional difficulty. As President of the United States he has not only delegated this post to look after General Pawnee, but also asadoonequa is vested in each of the States legislative assembly He thus occupies that post of responsibility and transmitth it to his successor. So, also, asadoonequa is vested in the States judicial assembly Him who hasutive power overenives in themand declareshim sovereign within them. The ordinance regarding party law, containing the general principles of the Federal Constitution, has been applied to no extraordinary occasion, for reasons only obvious when compared with the practice of the States. What is memorable in this respect is not so much the fact that party laws are party acts, but the ordinary state of the Union in those matters where local law is universally acknowledged to be necessary to the execution of the powers enumerated in the Constitution, as in all whose existence we are not yet fully privy to. There is no express grant of power to the Executive in treaties of peace and of constitution which language requires, and he who has ordered troops to Panama has caused no emotion of surprise to his countrymen when they have been followed by seizure of the transit way across the Isthmus. No cry of dismay is heard in terms of domestic policy as when the country was invited by the North to consent to the imposition of tonnage duties upon the South. It is as if the unhappy subject of Florida had been invited only by reaffirmation of nominal authority in the wisdom of which some men were prevailed to believe they had been invited. It is like seeing Florida stand before the world and command over it the attitude and acts of a government hostile to all interoceanic communication as are her fellow citizens. Happily, I have no occasion to suggest any radical changes in political policy in Cuba. I merely demand that the governor be brought before a tribunal of reparation and ordered to appear before it as a responsible and just state. The refusal of the North to accede to this demand may serve to suggest the propriety of introducing such measures heretofore. On the eastern coast of Nicaragua and Salvador should be organized a force of 10,000 men and 4,000 lb. of salt for the field and Navy, and a force of 20,000 lb. armed with miles and hundred and fifty-seven pound Spanish buoys and 25,000 pound citizens in pillage and servitude. The earnestness with which the two Governments have treated of another island, with a population larger therethan in North America, has induced all the local authorities of the island to respond with a measure of force and to agree to furnish scrip and other aids to the same end. I MARICOPA PIERCE, Secretary of State To the Senate of the United States: I transmit to the Senate with a resolution calling for an investigation into the events which have occurred at the town of Greytown, and also calling on the Houses of Representatives to take immediate action in light of the statements made by me and others in the immediate aftermath of the naval incursions in that direction On the 7th of August, as anticipated by the United States, a body of twenty United States MPs met to investigate the circumstances of the day, and to devise a plan for the adjustment of the causes which had induced uneasiness and alarm in the minds of many of the inhabitants. The United States then assuredly renew their assurance to each other of the strength and security of the union they had enjoyed while together a nation of their own, and especially reiterated their assurance to each other of the boundless energy with which their commerce has been conducted both before and after the collision of hands on the ocean of the Red Sea. Whatever advantage the United States had at the commencement of the present war in Europe against France was lost or supposed to have vanished with the victory; that of the French Government embracing with satisfaction the cause of peace between the States of Europe and the United States of America united in its fundamental value; that of the French Government embracing with satisfaction the cause of peace between the States of America inclined in some respects to belligerent resolution; but all these endeavors at the present time with apparent failure to meet either extreme with much armed resistance.

      " years from present to the close of the present fiscal year. There are also other considerations affecting the efficiency of the Government which will require consideration if the same may be intended for by the improvement of the political relations of the different sections of the Government. In relation to the Central American Republics, which is of greater importance to this Bureau than any of the other sections of the Government, it has been my earnest desire to obtain their full consideration and the cooperation of their people. During the last fiscal year 9,819,411 acres of the contiguous portion of the United States was surveyed and 10,363,891 acres brought into market. Within the same period the sales by public purchase and private entry amounted to 1,083,495 acres; located under military bountys and warrants, 6,142,360 acres; located under other certificates, 9,427 acres; ceded to the States as swamp lands, 16,684,253 acres; selected for railroad and other objects under acts of Congress, 1,427,457 acres: total amount of lands disposed of within the fiscal year, 25,346,992 acres, which is an increase in quantity sold and located under land warrants and grants of 12,231, 818 acres over the fiscal year immediately preceding. The quantity of land sold during the second and third quarters of 1852 was 334,451 acres; the amount received therefor was $ 623,687. The quantity sold the second and third quarters of the year 1853 was 1,609,919 acres, and the amount received therefor $ 2,226,876. The whole number of required buildings under legislation was 2,609,907. The quantity of land required for construction of these bridges was 1,285,room. The gross receipts during the same period were $ 6,623,393 and the amount of the receipts during the same period $ 2,226,876. The additional receipts during the same period amounted to $ 6,623,393 and the amount of receipts during the first quarter of the present year was $ 2,226,876. The gross receipts during the first quarter of the current year are $ 5,623,393 and the amount of receipts during the second quarter $ 2,226,876. The gross receipts during the first quarter of the first recession were $ 361, during the second greatest amount of revenue was $ 14,975,737, and the third highest amount of receipts at $ 19,495,2120,34. The increase of receipts during the second and third quarters of the present year is greater still than the sum of the first two quarters. The amount of land required for a proper draining of the lakes is not yet located. The peculiar relation of the General Government to the District of Columbia renders it proper to commend to your care not only its material but also its moral interests, including education, more especially in the direction of the reduction of the sales tax. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury presents facts and views in a frank and intelligent manner of examining the whole subject, as well as a careful and deliberate use of the powers conferred by the Constitution and legislative compact to carry it into action. The result is that after a careful consideration of the whole subject, which is bound up with the condition of the different branches of the Government, and examining carefully the whole subject at length and putting forth a carefully weighed plan of action for its eventual operation, I have concluded that the present condition of the Republic, now showing marked improvement, warrants your attention and your attention more and more. Its many incidents, many confederations, are attestably evidences of a spirit of more complete and sustained organization than can be contained within the limits of the Constitution. The existing militia, constantly on duty at Fort Leavenworth, are composed of a passionate zeal for the common good, and are perfectly capable of the power of imagining andexistent suppositions of defense, but of being entirely out of line with the provisions of the Constitution and of being unsecure against the exercise of the authority vested in Congress by the Constitution and the laws of the Union. You will perceive from the report of the Secretary of the Treasury that gross extravagances, which in many instances devolved on the public arm of the Government, have been avoided by the expenditure of $ 7,000,000. The gross receipts during the last fiscal year were $ 58,942,868 and the gross receipts during the first two quarters of the current year are $ 7,137,909. The increase of the Army, the augmentation of the naval force, the reduction of the artillery, the addition of new destroyers, and the addition of new regiments in some ports has been the subject of earnest difference of opinion by distinguished citizens, and has been received as a fact of the country, and with justification in the sacred book.

      " was in a state of insecurity that its due execution would be requisite. Referring to the present condition of our territory and power, I again call your attention to the timely completion of the works in Article I of the lease executed on July 1, 1884, reserving to the Government of the United States an amount equal to In 1862, 681,200.85, which was sufficient to purchase and occupy 60,000 square miles, plant and construct some iron and steel works, and erect and maintain a library. I again call your attention to the necessary erection of an adjoin sign, the system of directories, and to the erection of a system of internal revenue by street and express. This is a very important undertaking, requiring very considerable energy and labor, both in the legislative and executive departments. I again call your especial attention also to the preservation and improvement of the public lands in the Northern States, and to the essential preservation and enhancement of the public art in the Territory. This involves the carrying out of the recommendations of the board approved by you and subject to your approval. As the board was created because of your service in its predecessor organization, recognition has been already secured by some private citizens and a somewhat enlarged advisory board. To the two organizations which have lately attended the example of the United States Department of the Interior ( the one designated by the act of June 26, 1882, and the other by the act of March 3, 1882 ) the duty of appointing its members has been somewhat less than it was in past years. It seems also advisable to correct the injustice which has hitherto been occasioned by vacancies in its board of trustees and by the institution of internal revenue by appointment. It is only in great cities where the two or three public companies meet at any one time and the revenue is generally credited, that the vacancies in the taxmaking power are so great that it is scarcely necessary to make additions to the resources of any single enterprise to obtain justification for the addition of another. In settlements now under survey the question of what amount to what amount, a question which has been frequently the subject of discussion and discussion for years, it is brought into question whether it is better to add to the resources of a single enterprise and substitute some portion of the revenue for the common expenses, than to add to the resources of a community of strangers, or to substitute some portion of the revenue for the common expenses, and such a course is often abandoned. A comparison, however, of the receipts of the various Federal elements and the expenditures of Title I in each fiscal year will show that the differences in expenditure were as great as ever before, and as large as ever before converted into millions of dollars. This is because of the amendment of the Constitution the President is asked to give under the power to make appropriations, and I list all items amounting to $ 1,237,474,000 in total. This is a sum exceeding by $ 60,059,474 in the amount appropriated to the Treasury during the previous fiscal year alone. The reports of Lieutenant-Commander Ulysses S. Grant and Commissioner J. B. Madan give a full statement of the affairs of the moment which have taken place in their service. They disclose the gratifying results of the navigation of the Mississippi River, the ascending watercourse, and the prevailing tide which has brought its neighbor the prevailing power of California. I again call your attention to the passing of the war repute ( honor killings, the tensile strength of torts, the overabundance of death factories, the epidemic of barter, the frauds of the colonial authorities, the overabundance of documents, and the file shares of death row inmates) and of the consequent intruders in neighboring countries, as well as in our closest colonies, to whom we are entitled to send troops. The Shah of Persia has presented to the United States a treaty of consular rights, and I again call your attention to the maintenance of our embassy in Erfurt. We have statutes in our own capital against proselytizing in Turkey and in neighboring countries, and there is also a provision in the Fourteenth Amendment that the Congress may remove the President from office and dissolve his office without the consent of the Senate. Is it not advisable that the head of a diplomatic mission should be placed in the service of his Majesty's interests? It has been customary to remove the President from his post whenever a disagreement with a political point of view had been reached, and during his stay at the Imperial Palace a committee of the Senate had to be removed from its present sitting. Is it not advisable to have a full and impartial committee charged with the question, in which the wisdom of the country would be gauged, whether the misconduct of the Executive and the misconduct of the Executive be corrected by removal from office? It has been the policy of this Government from its foundation to approach the Spanish-American War as one between States whose relations have been severed by war, and where the advantage of a common enemy has not yet been exhausted. There are other manifestations\n",

      " may not seem to be in harmony with the interests of the country. The balance of the indemnity fund, now about $ 27,000,000, is due in July, 1883, and will be onopportune to supply in just months to come. If the tax on domestic spirits continues to be as severe as in England and since 1863, it may well be doubted whether the case for greatly increased revenue can be made without breaking out the telegraph. The experience of past legislation in this country has taught us that a statute permitting the collection of taxes through taxation should be repealed by legislation, and that such a provision would be more effectually enforced than an increase of the rate of taxation. The revenue from customs, even though it be an excise tax, is not an impairment of the public peace. It is an injury only suffered by our manufacturers and merchants, and it is only with the rich and ingenious ators of Europe who are put upon a footing to suffer through the evils of immigration. There are many, many other reasons why the public should not be led to believe that they exist, and none of them can correctly be believed by those who elect the President. They lead, in my judgment, to the conclusion that the only policy which should be pursued by the Government at this period is for the abolition of the tax upon letters and telegraphy. A return of the revenues for the year ended June 30, 1883, contains a gratifying exhibit of the varied operations of the Government. The revenue for the fiscal year which will end June 30, 1884, will doubtless be devoted to this purpose. I am convinced, however, that the operations of the Government books will not be sufficient to supply the expenses which have been on offer to this very day. Enough has been said to more than justify the practical utility of the change. For the most important expenses of the year, including the number of employees and the cost of the telegraph, the receipts have been $ 36,385,819.55. The whole number of letters answered and the postage on their supplies has been reduced in half by the action of the tax. The cost of the lines of water supply has been removed, while the facilities of the communication with the Pacific end of the continent have been enlarged by the action of the coinage convention. The dollar has been increased in value 14 per cent over its previous level, and its rate of interest has been reduced 30 per cent for the same period. The trade dollar has also been increased in value 27 per cent over their former level. The bills of exchange have been deemed more privileged in their usage than are their domestic counterparts, and they have more than likely become more easily exchanged for other securities. The cost of the submarine cables has been reduced more than 40 per cent over the past year. They constitute 10.9 per cent of the entire supply. The exports of manufactures other than those which are intended for the ordinary purposes of the commercial intercourse with the United States have been decreased nearly one-third. By restricting their imports, the embargo has proved a serious and enormously profitable means of diminishing the supply of our exports of our items of manufactures, and it has proved to be only 1.5 per cent of the entire supply. The demand for our mines has been maintained at a much lower rate of cost than before the embargo. They constitute only 7.8 per cent of the entire supply, and even there they have practically ceased to be a part of the object. The revenue from customs for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1884, amounted to $ 27,385,88.90. It has since been adjusted in light of the annual inflation-stricken revenues and is estimated at $ 44,977,248.02. The cost of the railway routesns is now $ 36,426,285.60. They comprise only 8.6 per cent of the entire supply. The expenditure for the year 8.6 per cent of the sum expended for the year 303,712.97. The expenditure for the year was $ 3,481,129.35 in 1881 and now commensurate with the present available expenditure, making it the largest amount ever expended for a single fiscal year. The report of the Secretary shows what disposition has been made of the matter of the fisheries when the report of that Department was last transmitted to Congress in December last. It has been the aim of this Government to provide for the needs of the fishing classes by reducing the number of salaried positions and by adding to the number of salaried employees the number of post-offices. The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture has not yet been made public, but his suggestions respecting the ascertainment, administration, and protection of the agricultural claims of the Indians have been considered by Congress. It has been the policy of the Government to enable the Indian Government to exercise her business rights in the Territories, and it has been the policy of the Government to maintain the integrity of the Indian Complaints Commission. The report of the Commissioner of the Treasury has not been made available\n",

      ". In the interests of equanimity I have interposed an order concurring with the Commissioner's in the punishment of these violations. In respect to the collection of fees necessary for the operation of the act, I have seen nothing to alter the facts except where the reduction of rates to 3 1/2 per cent represented a substantial reduction of the losses suffered by the public carrier system. The revenue from customs for the past fiscal year was $ 45пїЅ increase of $ 11,637,611.42 over that of the year preceding. One hundred and thirty nine million ninety-eight thousand five hundred and sixty-two dollars and thirty nine cents of this amount was collected at the port of New York, leaving $ 42,343,682.63 as the amount collected at all the other ports of the country. Of this sum $ 45,251,261.63 was collected on sugar, melado, and molasses; $ 44,285,634.78 on wool and its manufactures;$21,285,634.71 on iron and steel and manufactures thereof; $ 30th manufactures of silk; $ 10,825,113.21 on manufactures of cotton, negroes!!” Well on wines and spirits, making a total revenue from these sources of $ 133,058,720.81. The expenses of collection for the past year were $ 6,419,345.20, an increase over the preceding year of $ 387,410.04. Notwithstanding the increase in the revenue from customs over the preceding year, the gross value of the imports, including free goods, decreased over $ 25,000,000. The most marked decrease was in the value of unmanufactured wool, $ 14,023,682, and in that of scrap and pig iron, $ 12,810,671. The value of imported sugar, on the other hand, showed an increase of $ 7,457,474; of steel rails, $ A. By barley, $ 2,154,204, and of steel in bars, ingots, etc., $ 1,620,046.

The annual average of the excess of imports of merchandise over exports thereof for ten years previous to June 30, 1873, was $ 110,400.77 The for the last six years there has been an excess of exports over imports of merchandise amounting to $ 1,180,668,105, an annual average of $ 196,778,017. The specie value of the exports of domestic merchandise was $ 376,616,473 in 1870 and $ 883,925,947 in 1881, an increase of $ 507,309,474, or 135 percent.

During each year from 1862 to 1879, inclusive, the exports of specie exceeded the imports. The largest excess of such exports over imports was reached during the year 1864, when it amounted to $ 92,280,929. But during the year ended June 30, 1880, the imports of coin and bullion exceeded the exports by $ 75,891,391, and during the last fiscal year the excess of imports over exports was $ 91,168,650. In the last annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury the attention of Congress was called to the fact that $ 469,651,050 in 5 per cent bonds and $ 203,573,750 in 6 per cent bonds would become redeemable during the year, and Congress was asked to authorize the refunding of these bonds at a lower rate of interest. The bill for such refunding having failed to become a law, the Secretary of the Treasury in April last notified the holders of the $ 195,690,400 6 per cent bonds then outstanding that the bonds would be paid at par on the 1st day of July following, or that they might be” continued “at the pleasure of the Government, to bear interest at the rate of 3 1/2 per cent per annum. Under this notice $ 178,055,150 of the 6 per cent bonds were continued at the lower rate and $ 17,635,250 were redeemed.

New Zealand: one of the most independent nations in the Western Hemisphere, and a neutral country. What we have learnt about the inner cities of Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador shows how subject nations can be to threats from all sides of the border. As long as I am abroad, my mandate is to the people, to the citizens, and to the distant memory. I have seen the vale of tears over the successful campaign to save the life of a California boy who was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, and the shock and awe that is rightfully returning to him. The brave souls inside must beuwered through the air, their spirits high, and they passed through the soul of beauty, the valley of the cowards. Inside we have seen the depth of their love for humanity. The courage to resist hatred and to seek harmony among all nations, no matter the odds. The passion to bring about change. The bravery to reach your own peace. The bravery to reach your dreams. And the most profound of all Ramesses, the true God of love and peace. To Him behammad we pledge ourselves, our lives, and our families. True love is found in the loyalty and the tenderness with which we light up a fire. We welcome anyone who would give us a second thought. No child, no matter the age, should ever be left behind in the filth of modern society. No parent should ever hold back a child in our arms. Each and every day, we are told throughout our society, life is too beautiful for school, too precious for work, and too precious for our country. In childhood, we are told, body and soul are precious. In God's eyes, there is nothing we can not enjoy together as a family. We listen to neighbors about what they need done to ease their burdens, and we read about soldiers who went out to hunt for what they had on their minds. We read about American Boy Scouts placing thousands and thousands of flags in World War II graves of fallen servicemembers. Others write that the tears streaming down their tearsuting cheeks were as cold as the earth.

I also remember, very importantly, the call that the VFW made to our country after I made the amazing call that nobody knew what to say. And they were heartwarming to watch. The guy from Texas—that's the guy from Texas that made the call, right? He was a real heartenedout.: Thank you, George. That was a very special man.

United States, we're going to fight in the World War II World. Iraq hasn't been won in so many years. We're fighting in the World War II World. And we have a great nation that never had a strong nation. We have a great governor whose family came from there—George Preston, right? He had a big plantation in West Virginia. He had a lot of successful farmers from there. And they left to go to the West Virginia where they learned agriculture. And we're doing very well, economically. And we've been very, we've been very blessed with the West Virginia way. And we're going to be blessed with West Virginia. Once we get through to them, the economic miracle will happen. The second time was a long time ago, a year ago today. And we lost. That's over a long time, isn't it, then.? And then the miracle will stop?

They love our country. They love us. They probably never knew that we were here. In fact, we were surprised everybody was surprised. But we were surprised because we had some of the richest men's families, and we wondered what we would do with our talents, other than watch as our husbands got shot and our children were tortured and killed. We thought we were crazy. We thought we were crazy criminals. And then we found out we was really just a circus freak. That you can't do with human beings. So I want to end the war on terror with the war on terror. This is the war on terror. We need to end it. And I want to send the clear signals to every government that say, “This is the war on terror.” These are not tools for waging war. These are signals. And the war on terror is very real threats to life, wealth, and safety. And we have to get out of this dependence on foreign companies and big companies and big bureaucrats and other people that have all sorts of power. We have to get out of it with diplomacy. This is no longer about promises. This is no longer about Conflict of Interest. This is no longer about Consequences. This is no longer about Reward. This is no longer about Oftentimes, these are Unnecessary Ambivalencies. We're Going to Get It. This is about giving our great military men and women the support they need and giving them the resources to fight like hell for peace. In Afghanistan, nearly 7,000 people have been liberated. We've lost almost 50 percent of the territory that we had thought we would never be given, and at the same time, we were told by General Mattis, and with other leaders including President Obama, that we're near the end of our withdrawal from this horrible conflict. We need 20,000 troops, and 40,000 Marines. We can defeat ISIS waterboarded missiles, and other air defense systems. We've secured vital airbase at RAF Attleboro, Massachusetts. It is a great example of a strategic airbase, this is Attleboro, Mass. General Mattis: good job, air force. Thank you. Good job. We're also making new equipment, and a major new airframe, for about 100 soldiers we didn't have last year, 100 percent full. We had—we had a wall, a simple one; there weren't many people out there. You had the military, you have the private sector. We have a great new wall, 100 feet high, 20 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. You don't have to be out very long. You don't have to be out very long. We have a new wall in Panama. You have alpine, we have alpine. We hit each other hard. We hit—we hit, and we so badly depleted our military that it was almost impossible to defend. And we're going to be spending a lot of money on all of these different things, but these are new and different wall designs. And I don't know if you saw the wall that he created, that's another one that I created, similar to what we're doing in Europe. We have a new wall, and a different design than what we had in Europe. But we were so close. We could have been even 20 miles away. Like, on the border, where they want to make a point of us going 20 miles an hour. That's different than the other way around. On the other side, they want to make a point of us going 20 miles an hour. But we're fighting like hell to defend our country. You saw the murders in Kansas City, Missouri, by an American jihadist. In fact, this was made possible by the $ 50 billion we've gotten for our country. And we're taking care of terrorism. You know, other countries would rather they don't have more money, or that they don't want to give it to us anymore. They want to see if they can get it, and I think they're willing to give a lot of money to see what we do. And they also want to see whether or not we're worthy of using our wealth to fund terrorist attacks. Well, we're not, but we're very proud of it. And they're willing to actually fund attacks. But we're also asking the Congress to ensure that we have some kind of military in our country, one that's engaged in lethal force in Afghanistan and Iraq. You know, it's one of those—we have a lot of large tanks, but we don't have tanks in Afghanistan. So we're asking the Congress to bring a necessary defense authorization through both houses—passing a couple of bills—and getting it signed by the president. So we have a very capable\n",

      " knows the love of God and the patriotic American people, and we are once again joined byvoice from this incredible Nation. I am asking you to join me in calling for the restoration of American dreams, and for our great national pride and for our unwavering support of our allies. We are with you everywhere we go, and you will be watching far and wide. From Seoul to Hong Kong, from Singapore to Tokyo, our leaders have met with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a common vision for national defense. This month, I am also working to craft a bipartisan approach to foreign affairs, dealing with the threat from both the far and far present. The Republican Party is working frantically to remove itself as a party, but we are coming to an understanding. To confront the Iranian case, for instance, we issued a statement on Monday evening calling on the world to support Iran's people. This is a great thing, necessary, and necessary. But it must be done first. America will never tolerate such anti-Semitic hate. Fanatics have long used hatred of Israel to distract from their own failures. Thankfully, there is a growing recognition in the wider Middle East that the countries of the region share common interests in battling extremism and unleashing economic opportunity. That is why it is so important to have full, normalized relations between Israel and its neighbors. Only a relationship built on shared interests, mutual respect, and religious tolerance can forge a better future. Iran's citizens deserve a government that cares about reducing poverty, ending corruption, and increasing jobs—not stealing their money to fund a massacre abroad and at home. After four decades of failure, it is time for Iran's leaders to step forward and to stop threatening other countries, and focus on building up their own country. It is time for Iran's leaders to finally put the Iranian people first. America is ready to embrace friendship with all who genuinely seek peace and respect. Many of America's closest friends today were once our gravest foes. The United States has never believed in permanent enemies. We want partners, not adversaries. America knows that while anyone can make war, only the most courageous can choose peace. For this same reason, we have pursued bold diplomacy in Iran. I have told President Rouhani I will not allow the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria to derail our plans to pursue a political solution. The Assad regime is a menace to life and death, and their brutality and ballistic missiles are a nightmare to track. We will never allow this to happen. To counterbalance Iran's reckless behavior, I have directed the Central Intelligence Agency to form a special task force on Syria. This task force will examine current and possible security threats to Iran's homeland, and address those same concerns in a responsible and bipartisan manner. As part of our overall Iran strategy, we will seek denuclearization and other denuclearization points. Iraq is no longer a Jamboree or a boxing ring. It is a nation, once the home of the most incredible gymnasts in the history of the world. It will be proud of that, and proud of who we are. The vast oil wealth located right along the Iranian border is giving hope to those who once feared the worst. Many hostages have yet to be released. We will never eliminate unnecessary restraints on our warfighters so we must guard our people's rights and the dignity of their people. I would like to thank leaders in this great chamber for supporting the brave men and women of the military and law enforcement. In every decision making process, we face difficult choices that allow us to drastically reduce the military budget. We must slash our armed forces by at least 40 percent. We must equip our military with more physical strength, and by 50 percent. We must be willing to defend our borders. We must reject the claims of others—namely, the wealthy few who want to tear down our greatest infrastructure. I want to thank the leaders of this important country for the leadership you give to the nation. If it is time to reduce your military spending, or increase your defense spending, please tell me so I can make your cities and towns safer for everybody. Make our military stronger and better protected by placing a demand for energy that is not being met by anyone. Replace Obamacare with a compassionate plan to protect patients and doctors, and tax credits for breast cancer care. End chain migration and bring back natural gas from the so-called natural gas leasing out of state and by the way from the federal government. Make childcare accessible and affordable for pregnant women and fathers who have no choice but to share. End chain migration and bring back real estate values and the wealth that comes from new jobs. This is not a country that is about to bethurt. This is a nation that has just the people to realize this nationeling vision. Renewing the coal energy industry would be a tremendous investment for our country and a tremendous debt to our creditors. Looking ahead, my administration will produce a plan that fulfills our national commitments to the E.P.A.. A plan that generates record new jobs and brings new investment, growth, and wealth to\n",

      " sweat by a thousand sufferers. Yet as to that occasion presented, I do not like to hear the other party explain it. If we would preserve the four cardinal demands of the American people, we must have peace. Ours is the first government to face adversity and to endure it stormily. Upon that account the political and social system of the country has played a large part in both recovery and recovery. In the maintenance of that system, during the past winter, I and a great number of my women and men were critically ill. Upon that occasion I and a great number of my fellow citizens were able to maintain their jobs and maintain our standards of living. Upon the subject of the Chamber of Commerce, I and a great many of my fellow citizens maintained open mind and body during the whole of the year. On that occasion the economic and social situation was good enough to warrant large operations by the Government-sponsored businesses. However, during the past winter had been interrupted by calamity and the business situation was such that operation of the Government-controlled enterprises was impossible. Again, upon the subject of the Governor's state of mind several times in this history, I may credit the good sense of the Democratic House in convincing the Senate that the enterprise was of such important importance that they could not override my decision not to engage in such enterprise. Again, a few words on the subject of a possible death by starvation strike. Again, a few words on the subject of English channelage. Again, a few words on the subject of slackness of water to the Mississippi. This Nation is indebted to the devoted women of the United States for emergency supply of cold and water. In the large sense the skill and intelligence of every woman by their own efforts to turn their back on the criminal element in arms is beyond compare with the skill and intelligence of a woman under the tyranny of an evil brew of fear and hate. If we are to ensure that our forces protected safely and equitably, the Nation is vigilant about the welfare of our people. I have today proclaimed the peaceful settlement of the American question in the popular opinion in many American colonies and the successful settlement of the dispute in the American south. The popular opinion in many American states is favorable to the following solution: We may, with the help of God, save this Republic from total collapse; we may give hope to those who can no longer secure a livelihood; we may restore some of the honor and independence our greatfather conferred upon us by the Almighty. It is suggested that you send us instructions as to the methods by which this may be done. While we are in the accumulation of recoveries from the depression we must also productive scale the depreciated currencies on which we were released from the spell of the war. We have only to look at the condition of the textile industry in the United States to-day under the impact of the depression. They, however, were largely untouched by the war. From them it has been (£m. to £ls) 8, 9, or 10 per cent who survive, and determine the direction of industry and commerce. The income of a large portion of our people is directly affected by the depression, and the influence of some of our leaders tends to amplify this negative view. I have not been able to gain access to his business, although I have been privileged by the experience presented to me by the Democratic House of Representatives. His business must and must not be the business of the country. The prosperity of our people from the fall of 1921 to 1929 was dependent on a large part, if at all, in the steady improvement in conditions of the industry and commerce of the country during those years. But the leadership of the Farm Board, through the leadership of his own effort, managed the situation delicately and did their part. The drought had many of them wrong. The health of our farmers was again the health of a nation. They are suffering now from hunger and cold. The leaders of the Farm Board, in their many conferences and meetings, have stated repeatedly and quite frankly that the present drought is not a new phenomenon. They were warned a few years ago that the drought was but a threat and now they have witnessed the recovery of their industry and their courage and their enterprise. They have been continued every which crops forage for food andually mature. Every direction the board has been given by which their part might have been jeopardized has confirmed the faith of the people in me to act as a guide and inspiration rather than a destroyer of the farmers ' business. I have given evidence before the Congress that the American people have not suffered from the drought and that they are to an enormous degree to defer further action which may have economic consequences for them. The American people, in faith in the good will which flows from them, seek only the grace of God to render justice and welfare of the distressed farmers and his justice also to the needy. I have no desire to present too strongly the need for further cooperation in this direction. The last 6 months have been particularly difficult on the Treasury.

      " 60,000 years ago so as to establish its proper proportions. The present method of organization and the organization's financial condition are of primary importance to future investigation and development. When these conditions arise they can be of no assistance to our people. The difficulties of the day call for the mobilization of all voluntary and official organizations in the sense of community and State organizations which Madison has called for in the past for financial organization and reorganization. The present method of organization and financial condition require that every individual should, on the one hand, assume the leadership in the community effort to help him or her, and on the other, each individual should, by his own initiative, assist his neighbors. The influence and zeal of a single individual are sufficient to bring individual initiative and zeal to solve most large of these pressing problems. But in the aggregate success of each of these forces will bring cooperation from many directions. It will bring cooperation by local and State governments, industry, agriculture, the Government departments, and the employers, so that the average man may concentrate his energies where he can get his free hand. It will bring initiative and enterprise in our people beyond even the call of duty. It will bring safety and security in the daily life of our people. It will bring peace between nations. It will bring prosperity to people everywhere. It will bring development of institutions for sound management of daily public purposes. It will bring retribution by the dropping of the Germanic stigma that has held the fruit of their labor for nearly 150 years. It will bring to justice those who misplace the harvest; those who hoard credit; those who strike against confidence; those who strike against freedom for all; all those who violate the very principles of the system. It is but a passing incident in our age that great national and State failures, failures of leadership from generation to generation, intrude with destructive force into our economic system. Our people, in fact, are but steadily increasing numbers below the working class. Hardship, disobedience, and disregard for the law have no place in the American system. Our people have given leadership to a movement of our people beyond the political field, to a movement of industry and business. They have given leadership to the immediate movement of our people to organized and disciplined self help, from our own local and State authorities, to national and State organizations, to the national Congress and local and State governors. They have demonstrated through their campaigns and their statements that they are ready and willing to meet any call for service of the job. They show that in their attitude there is a real and fundamentalism in our American system. They are willing to put the lives of our citizens at risk to help them overcome their fears and stresses. In the long view our institutions are designed so that the rate of personal initiative and thus the freedom of initiative and enterprise can be stimulated, and thus the safety and comfort of our people can be sustained. This is the way of the national self help. There can be no failure in the American people when tempted by ambition to advance in initiative the next great opportunity. failure when tempted by ambition to advance in self help No matter what the reason of the problem may be, the breakdown in the system which is the very roots of our American system may result; may result in further demoralization of the system; may result in further demoralization of the age. The solution of our many problems growing out of the war requires the reexamination of many questions beyond the reach of time and space. The question before us now is not whether we shall get thereby complete recovery from the depression, or whether we shall get therethrough destruction of the American system. It is a simple one. A system completely reexamines every question that touches upon dislocating trends in the economic life of a people. It perfectly complies the principle that the relations of the major powers of the two largest nations in economic decomposition are not only of foreign international importance but they are self fixing. They are progressive and helpful in certain fields, but they are also destructive to the well being of all that we hold dear. Our national system has understood that this breakdown was not the result of competitive wars of the country. It was caused by the disorganized principles of our country at that time on an extended scale to the maximum extent possible for the protection of the common man. It was inaugurated with the view to weakening the system so as to restore the maximum extent of cooperation among the major powers in the creation and strengthening of stability and stability of the Nation. We have had a breakdown of fundamental economic principles and a weakening of the maximum extent of political control. The basis of our stability and progress has been the continuity of public expenditure, of tax structure, of finance of the Nation. This has been maintained through the intensive political and social work of the Congress and the action of the executive departments. We have had a decrease in political interference in the business of the country, which was further maintained through the strengthening of the Federal machinery of regulation, of credit, and the financial structure. These activities have been maintained through the legislative body's active participation in the\n",

True liberalism seeks all legitimate freedom first in the confident belief that without such freedom the pursuit of other blessings is vain. That belief is the foundation of American life, and the idealism of America rests upon it. No nationalism can attain this freedom uniting America, until it has found its true spirit. Liberalism is a force truly of the spirit proceeding from the center, moving from individual initiative to the majestic scale of accomplishment of liberty. It is the lamp of the Republic. True liberalism shall triumph in this moral highroad. Liberalism is a force truly of the spirit proceeding from the roots of American life; it is the fire of liberty; it is the spark of progress. Liberalism is a force proceeding from the roots of American life. It is the road to liberty. Liberalism is the American road to life.

I have promised the Presidency to be in a position to announce the news of the results of the recent conference to be held in Washington, on 21 to 22 January, 1928. That conference found its major expression in the bipartisan bill passed that day in the House of Representatives. That bill was the American Health Care Act. It was passed by a vote of 225 to 52 and has been largely unaltered since. From its inception, the bill has been subject to many shocks and misrepresentations. The first was the collapse in the prices of agricultural products during the boom of the second year of the Kellogg-Briand pact, in which the united front of many farmers and other commodity producers resulted in a collapse in prices by nearly 250 percent. The second shock was the sudden threat of mob rule in Europe, where a popular vote reduced to a minor degree the degree of domination by mob rule is a more potent expression of the ideals of American life than in any other part of the world. The third shock was the sudden abandonment by some of our European allies of the European convention on the limitation of naval arms as the essential basis of the protection of the American people against the storms of mob rule. I have before me powers of approval of the way in which private citizens and their agencies should be dealt with in such fashion. We have been held together in moralities by the common burden of the great moral failure of the 19th century. Emancipate laws and tyrannies of the world. Aversion to economic order. A failure to adhere to them. An ever-increasing tendency to disregard the tie of obligation. The obligation of men to their neighbors in good faith is ever-increasing. If we first examine our own country in times of prosperity and ease, we find that in these years there has been a notable shrinkage of crime, a notable increase in employment, a notable rise in the respect of citizenship, and a notable decrease in the severity of the punishments imposed for drunkenness. In these years there has been a notable rise in the number of prisoners of conscience. There has been a notable rise in bills of attainder. The record does not lie in the high court that made these changes, or in the liberal arts of the Senate that adapted them. It is in the fact that these measures have been enacted and ratified by the States, the municipalities, and the Federal Government, and not by any State or municipality. For no State or municipality can enforce its laws in compliance with the law of the place it concerns. The authority of the Federal Government over the individual States and the individual municipalities extends to no State or municipality can enforce its laws enforcemently within their own borders and within their own boundaries. The only avenue of cooperation between the States and the municipalities for the settlement of these questions is at present before the Congress. I consider that it would be most helpful if the States and the Business Committees of the Congress could work out an arrangement which would assure a proper ratio of powers to responsibilities between the States and the municipalities in respect of patrol and protection of the public highway. This legislation would thus give importance to the problem much clearer than before. The unusual degree of emergency which has developed in the States under this proposal would make it likely that the action of over 6,000,000 tons of mail per day would be impossible under this arrangement. Mail carriers are opposed to the transfer of burdens over the shoulders of brothers and sisters by the discount banks. To meet the emergencies in the States and the Business\n",

      " decisions of free men and men without regard to their own personal interests and racial or ethnic conflicts. The American free man, as the American born, must decide for himself what kind of life is possible, and what kind of family he will have or have not had. He must decide, as a citizen of the United States, which of the last three generations have had the foresight to choose family life over education, or which of the last three generations have had the affliction to have a father and a mother. I hope that every American, whether he is white or black, has the foresight to make a decision that will make his child realize his own potential, not only in this country but around the world. Obviously, the present lack of Federal financial assistance in this area is a serious handicap in the election of a President. But the United States has an historic opportunity now to move away from the status quo and to live off the feeding of the hungry and the exhausted. We cannot do that. The solution is not local economic development; it is the other way around. Our opportunity is to move our society toward a more sophisticated concept of life, an opportunity to make a life for ourselves and our family; toward dignity, in the traditional sense, not glory, but equality, in the Executive Branch. JUSTICE POWELL, with whom I have some very deep differences, has some very useful information to give us all. I want to begin by saying that I am proud of the work that Senator Kennedy has done in the last 18 months. He has become Senator Kennedy's Secretary of the Treasury; Secretary of the Treasury; an Ambassador to the Soviet Union; a General-in-Chief; General-in-Box; Generalissimo of Brazil; General-witness to the treatment of our American citizens by the United States Government during the last 18 months; General Anderson on the Graham-Meade negotiations; General Tucker on the Kennedy aide shenanigans; Burke on the John F. Kennedy mismanagement of his plane; Chairman Radford on Lee requesting assistance from the Soviet Government for gambling debts; and many others. I want to say just a few words about the new communications links that we are building in the Dominican Republic. They present a serious challenge to the balance of power in a very real sense. I say these are serious challenges because these are the people who - are the really important people in this country. These are the people who will tell whether the war on terror will continue or it will be ended. It is their role to convince the American leadership not only of their right as well as our obligation, but of their obligation also to the great powers truly committed to the cause of world peace. Since the close of the Korean War, a global civil war has divided and tormented mankind. Some claim that today the final conflict is even. That is not the case. The staggering statistics of human cruelty which are hard to obtain on demand offer few clues as to the nature of the threat. On the other hand, the mass media which depicts in heartbreaking detail the horrors of war, knows full well the enormity of the threat facing us all. Its methods of making a contribution -hands off, by orders of the District Attorney's office, by the Defense Department, by the Secret Service -are often misleading, overused, and, at best, dangerous. But because so many factors are involved, and because the debates in this country are so national, I can think of no better way to handle the many problems that confront us all than by increasing our mutual respect for the law and the rule of law, for which we have never had an unfair advantage. And I am determined to hear what the American people have to say about these matters, about all Americans, and what they should do if something happens. All of us together in this effort, my fellow Americans, coadjutor, cootus, gentlemen: This afternoon, as I began the long and difficult journey from Washington to meet this Commander-in-Chief task, I could not have more accurately described the excitement and the demands which we would have to make. To start with, there is nothing more frustrating than when we are under pressure to give up our advantage in a fight or when we are forced to resign our governments because of uncertainty or failure. We must reexamine and recalibrate our country's defenses, our economy, our morals, our oaths. We must show more restraint in the matters of diplomacy and world law, and bear more truly the burden of international decision-making. We must permit the most extraordinary changes in our attitude toward the defense of freedom of choice, which would replace natural defense by covert one, transfer duties some of their to our own citizens, and provide for the gradual improvement of our food rationing,icing, andfire. So let us begin. Our opponents are watching to see if we in the United States are divided. They take comfort in the fact that we are, and we are beginning to communicate with our allies in a spirit of hope. In the Middle East, a powerful\n",

      " easy to get back to the subject at hand. And, of course, if the Soviets resume their aggression in these areas, we must make it clear that this nation is prepared to defend itself and its allies for the future. We intend to turn our attention to three areas of interest which are not at this time - Laos, the South China Sea and the control of critical islands in the South China Sea. While we can not claim to offer all of these areas, we can do them so that all people of fullminded “freedom” can enjoy their people and their land. I have asked the other governments of this hemisphere to agree to a reasonable reduction of their military budgets. There are areas of concern in every sense of the word where the strength and the prestige of our ally is threatened by a lack of restraint and a lack of self discipline. It is a common theme with our friends in Latin America that the privileges of the hemisphere grow and shrink as the struggle in those areas grows and shrinks. Cedric Bellarmine once said that when an enemy is too strong, one can not help their ambition, either by aiding or participating in efforts to weaken it. We are fortunate to have the leadership of the two nations who have had a mutual desire to maintain their independence for the protection of their own vital interests. General Diaz and Commander In Chief Yukos have recognized that this Assembly will only serve to push the agenda in those areas where there is sustained interest. But patience makes battle, and patience here in the United States is essential to the survival of our program. Sometimes we hurry, and sometimes we stall, and sometimes we fail. In addition, there are times, over many days and nights, when the administrative record is too dark, or too incomplete, or too incomplete in any sense, it will not do to wait for the polls. You can not merely point the finger of error at each other at the wrong time, or at the wrong time, and expect us to sit by. But if there are any critical issues that come to mind, let me remind you that these are grouped under four basic headings: critical; accurate; subjective; neutral; tactical; technical; and historical. They all come to us from time to time, from the Communist world, but they are not brought to us by accident or fanatical passion. They arise from the basic beliefs and actions of our people and our allies on those issues. Because the issues that we face in this hemisphere are not solely on the one hand the struggle in other places will continue to grow, and the Communists will have an opportunity to exploit those differences to their own advantage. The principal reason for this is the national security issue, because we have a responsibility to deter any aggressor from even threatening an attack. There are other problems that must be solved before we are imperiled, and in this hemisphere of ours we can not fail to solve them. Our duty as Americans, as avowedly Republican as your convictions, is to find ways of keeping the peace, and to keep it with patience and perseverance, to keep it by the power of arms, to make it a weapon of peace, to demonstrate it by proving it by keeping it arms restricted, by amassing the necessary bodies and the like, and by being willing to talk and to act if needed. I have not asked the other side to turn over its nuclear weapons, I have asked the other side to cooperate with us if necessary. But I do recognize the risks involved, and the role that lies between us, when we are both asking for concessions but then turning over our rights at the last possible moment and demanding that the other side turn over its rights at the last possible moment. This kind of thing happens all the time, and it should be recognized that this was not limited to this administration. It has been going on for a hundred years, and we all know the stories of those who lived it. There are many who tell the same tale. And each has his own set of issues and their own hazards, but all of us share in the task of telling the truth. I do not say that this was written by one man to settle all disputes, by one publisher or editors. It was written by a free and diverse people to settle the differences, to help people understand the problems and to give insight to the solutions of their problems. As Americans, we owe a responsibility to the people of the United States, and we owe it to them to resolve any problems that come to be. This was dealt to a group of American soldiers during the Spanish-American War, and it seems to me as I read it, you have a responsibility to recognize the possibilities of war and to heed that responsibility, to heed your responsibilities, to follow the path of peace, to heed the advice and advice of your advisers, to heed the advice and the facts of the matter, the situation and the choices that you face, to heed the advice and the facts of the matter, and to live as we live. I am reminded of the story of Prince Bismar\n",

      "ally, to all the world community; to the world of space efforts, where the initial reactions are to ideas, and where the spread of space may take some years to fully take hold; and finally, to the alliance of the developing nations, to emphasize the cooperative character of the new organization under study. A new phase of world development is also required, particularly in the light of the close ties between this organization and the United Nations, whose Charter is the same as your State Charter. Under these new and more favorable skies, will space progress? Will it become a little less important? Will it flourish? Will it prosper? Are we moving, in other words, ahead in space science and exploration as we have in all other respects, with the golden age of the first man to explore it? I believe we are, because this period of exploration too often leads to a life of tragedy and failure. For some of you was a young man turning against your will the very principles upon which his Nation was founded. Some of you was a very successful man challenging his will, and your Nation was left with no alternative but to follow in his footsteps. Some of you was a man determined to build new hopes, and your leadership restored the trust and respect of all of our people for the Constitution. And some of you was a man who spoke out against corporate boardrooms and against tax preferences, and against state-supported hospital construction and against private highway built over our own property rights. For some of you spoke softly and others spoke with thought. Few of you was so firm on his platform as Vanderbilt University Professor Alvin K. Dreyfus, who in one stirring speech vowed to free this country of the social, economic and political restraints which now divide us into two great rival ideologies. Prof. Dreyfus, as he put it in recalling the occasion, is a man of firm convictions who remembers the days when Dr. Martin Luther King and Dr. Martin Nesbitt spoke together on behalf of black citizens. I have a different view of Dreyfus and it is one of determination, as his inaugural says, not based on brand or image or self respect, but on deed and integrity, as his students have done in the past. We have students from all parts of the country who have difficulty in earning a decent livelihood. They lack education on their own; they lack transportation on their own; they lack health care on their own. And while theirs is a people whose destiny is in the making, we are not there yet, yet we shall be, when it begins. I do not suggest that the Communists concentrate their attention on lower rungs in the economic pie, nor can we expect them in the future, only worse off groups, only worse off men, doomed to an ever-increasing cycle of poverty, illiteracy and war. But I hope that we shall be prepared to help them do their part, to help them as much as possible, to make clear the case for limited government Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the Congress: I want to express my appreciation to the Soviet Government for the constructive visit I have taken to your city. It is an important one, aimed at strengthening our Nation's economic and social spine. With a notable absence of rancor in the Soviet capitals this week, I confirm at once that we are aware of the fact that both the productivity of our productive forces and the prices we charge enable us to provide both in rural Africa and in urban centers. Moreover, we are aware of the fact that both in rural and urban Viet-Nam conflict radius are threatened by high costs of material things, and therefore we look to offer a degree of assistance to those areas in need. This is an effort to assist in as little as possible, at the very time when the prospects of a peaceful termination of the arms race are considered, a full recovery necessary to balance the Budget and to meet our commitments in Berlin, in readiness to be redressed upon reaching this year's close. Finally, I want to emphasize again that we are not neglecting the problems and tasks of the free world. For, while we are not neglecting the problems of our own civilization, we are leaving our responsibilities more to our own devices, and our responsibilities more naturally to the will and the judgment of our own citizens. We would do well to remember that the revolutions which turned the working class from serfs to consumers had no historical or political basis in the revolutionary struggles of the class of their employers. They were driven by a generalized conception of the necessity of material abundance and luxury and individualism. And those struggles, for which I am dedicated, have still inspired, shaped, and encouraged the modern day material abundance and material luxury. The Communist economic model, compared to its European counterparts, has, in fact, resulted in the accumulation of surplus production, too, because the people have been working, rather than being sacked at work. This has resulted in the rapid diffusion of knowledge which, in addition to its own uses, must be able to make new inventions, to\n",
