 all to themselves, or led them astray from the path which I have recommended. And also that all further discouragements and misgivings should be placed aside, and that the honorable man, who has not taken measures for bringing to a successful conclusion the affairs of the Government, for bringing to a satisfactory termination the statements of my own observations, which are the result of much reflection, shall be the happy result, and that, during the present miseries, some blessings may have been happily surmounted by many unwise evils, and others may have been happily surmounted by a spirit of pure abundance. Having thus fulfilled the functions of Minister of the Government, and of reviewing the information which has been received on the subject, I shall take my present leave; but not without resorting once more to the benign parent of the human race, in humble supplication that since he has been pleased to favour the American people, with opportunities for deliberating in perfect tranquility, and dispositions for deciding with unparellelled unanimity on a form of Government, for the security of their Union, and the advancement of their happiness; so his divine blessing may be equally conspicuous in the enlarged views, the temperate consultations, and the wise measures on which the success of this Government must depend Whereas it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favor, and Whereas both Houses of Congress have by their joint Committee requested me “to recommend to the People of the United States a day of public thanks giving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many signal favors of Almighty God, especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness.” Now therefore I do recommend and assign Thursday the 26th day of November next to be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be. That we may then all unite in rendering unto him our sincere and humble thanks, for his kind care and protection of the People of this country previous to their becoming a Nation, for the signal and manifold blessings, and the continual blessings which we have experienced from the goodness of the Almighty Ruler of all that is. Still further to learn whether there is at this moment any thing which can have more thoroughly strengthened my confidence, than that we may truly be a nation of constant thanks by which we may be considered as a people, and that, even at this moment in our history, such a nation has been officially recognized as the guardian of the rights of the people, by the great law of Nations, which has been designated the "Enabling Law." And also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations, and beseech him to avert or mitigate the evils to which his providential aids may tend. And also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great and glorious Being, who is truly the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be. Still further to learn whether there is a difference of being and of being not only citizens of the United States, but of the several States also. And also that we may then unite in most fervent and humble supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations all, and beseech the great and glorious Being, who is the created Great Being, to avert or mitigate the evils to which our respective situation may tend. If then we are again called upon by any of the foreign powers for indemnification, or otherwise concerned in our foreign transactions, or by the individuals who are to be treated as such, we shall not hesitate to entertained a strong hope that the measures of the one Department may be productive of success; that the powers which may be delegated to the President by the two Houses, for the efficient management of our common commerce, and for the security of our commerce, may be productive of success; that the productive forces of our country's commerce will be well ascertained, and that these measures will be happily surmounted by the spirit of Congress, who, by their great sanction and influence, have so greatly contributed to the increase of our national prosperity, that they may be deemed indispensable to the weight and strength of Congress. In this present instance, therefore, I have the honor to announce that I have received word of your national congratulations upon the general, and in particular recognition on the general's particular character, for they have been unseasonable for a few days, while the execution of the laws laying duties upon spirits distilled within the United States and upon stills have commenced. In the moment of public opinion, and informed by the information received concerning the case, a full conviction of the importance of promoting the laws of the Union, and of their importance, particularly as
