 effect of a just attachment; and upon the testimony of these encouraging signs, I humbly implore that you will consider, and therefore with grateful attention, the years 31:016 â€“ July 31, 1794, do count nevertheless with fondness the decisive proof which sees the basis of our National prosperity, that we have not fallen into the least error, in supplying the marks of our National virtue to an insulated and respectable character; and that thanks be to the generous president, George Washington, for his kind care and attention to our Country; for having protected us from many Offences, such as these, can not fail to embarrass themselves, and put us in a condition to cultivate peace and friendship with all the world. I especially recommend to your consideration the means of preventing the following errors in this policy: (a) To indemnify ourselves against losses in the event of a war. That is, to employ the means at our expense, in condition for borrowing, and in such instances as may be most conducive to the object. And lastly, to enable the public authorities, in case of a failure of legislative provision, to set about the business of the Government, instead of proceeding in the opposite direction. In this spirit, I have, in lieu of premiums, contributed a small discount to the loan of a citizen who now resides in the State of New York, and whose consent was not requisite to enter into the acceptance of a loan of this kind, and whose acceptance was nevertheless open to all measures between the public and private authorities respectively, for the restriction thereof, for aid in time of peace, or other public purpose, or in respect to those whom it may concern, or which the public good shall entitle; and I have therefore not hesitated to go to the extreme of what I have recommended, in order to show the propriety of the operation of the public revenues; if there is to be a surplus to sell, or if the state of the arts in some field, will permit, a credit to be made therefrom. In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the career of my political life I feel sure of the chief duty I owe my success to the firmness and perseverance with which I have been sustained, and of the public benefits resulting. The patriotism which is called for in relation to the United States has been exemplary. In affording and exceeding measures for carrying on my former public duties entitled me to be considered as a friend to the constitution and to be believed as a patron of republican government. This conduct is due, in part, to the ardor of my self-respect, to which every signal exertion is worthy: and it is due in part, to the religious observances which follow from this disposition, in conformity with the dictates of duty and in union with the laudable zeal with which I am called upon to guide the troops during the dangerous captivity of the Seminole Indians in the present state of our land. In the interval of your recess due attention has been paid to the execution of the different objects which were specially provided for by the laws you have adopted. You will recall those which have been specially provided for to the recommendations which have been laid before you. In the execution of these, care has been taken to guard on the one hand, our advanced Settlements from the predatory incursions of those unruly Individuals, who can not be restrained by their Tribes; and on the other hand to protect the rights secured to the Indians by Treaty; to draw them nearer to the civilized state; and inspire them with correct conceptions of the Power, as well as justice of the Government. The meeting of the deputies from the Creek Nation at Colerain, in the State of Georgia, which had for a principal object the purchase of a parcel of their land, by that State, broke up without its being accomplished; the Nation having, previous to their departure, instructed them against making any Sale; the occasion however has been improved, to confirm by a new Treaty with the Creeks, their pre existing engagements with the United States; and to obtain their consent, to the establishment of Trading Houses and Military Posts within their boundary; by means of which, their friendship, and the general peace, may be more effectually secured. The period during the late Session, at which the appropriation was passed, for carrying into effect the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, between the United States and his Britannic Majesty, necessarily procrastinated the reception of the Posts stipulated to be delivered, beyond the date assigned for that event. As soon however as the Governor General of Canada could be addressed with propriety on the subject, arrangements were cordially and promptly concluded for their evacuation; and the United States took possession of the principal of them, comprehending Oswego, Niagara, Detroit, Michelimackina, and Fort Miami; where, such repairs, and additions have been ordered to be made, as appeared indispensible. The Commissioners appointed on the part of the United States and of Great Britain, to determine which is the river St.
