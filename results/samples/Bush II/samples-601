 similar against America in the Cold War. I am confident in our mission, confident in our technology, confident in our approach to change. We're changing alliances and initiatives to better serve the needs of our economy, because we believe in the value of human life. We're transforming our health care system to meet the greatest needs of our time. We're transforming our education system to meet the needs of our time. We're transforming our immigration system to mirror our own and mirror the good work that America is doing. As we go forward, I hope we will never tire in our commitment to these two fundamental ideals. We must never stop working for the dignity and equality of every human being. And I ask you to give us the resources and the resolve to meet these aspirations. America has a great opportunity to lead the world in medical research that is by far the most dramatic and exciting of these programs. And I reject the claim that America is a 'leading nation' and that our research represents a 'comprehensive' goal. Because these are very different goals, and because I believe they are within our power, I have appointed Dr. Tony Fauci, a leading biomedical engineer and an early pioneer of modern medicine. Together, we will lead a global effort to advance cutting-edge medical advances while advancing science and innovation at the same time. In the coming years, we will expand the size and scope of our research effort so that America is a nation of scientists, not giants of the global science economy. In the coming years, we will expand the skill and reach of our military, leading advances in biotechnology before it is too late. America is leading the cause of medical progress. We're sharing ideas and techniques that enable us to make better use of new technology. We're exploring new chemical and biological weapons. We're investigating new treatments and cures for HIV and AIDS. We're improving housing and health care coverage for malaria. We're investigating new treatments and cures for human immunodeficiency virus type 2 or higher, which has the greatest impact on transmission and death rates. All these are preliminary steps, and future missions will require further research and development. Leading up to and including this year, the National Institutes of Health urged us to give priority to research that is highly regarded and has a proven track record. Now we must choose between these two vital priorities: innovative medicine that produces life that can live on, and breakthrough medical science that has the potential to replace it. Four years ago, I visited this very landmark and announced a new effort to support the advance of medical science over reliance on outdated medical science. I will continue to urge leaders in the medical world about the urgent need for scientific accountability. For our country to succeed, we must address the wrong problems early, helping them develop before disease swept our country. Problems that can derail progress and leave our citizens with no hope of hope. Problems that can undermine the momentum of a revolution. Problems that give way to a gallery of potential futures are the beginnings of promise and the foundation of a nation. Science will help us to resolve these problems, so I ask you to support their achievement. In the coming years, I expect to receive reports on more than 60 biomedical research projects that are eligible for funding. Each grant will help us to identify the research that best meets our national interest, and shall assist us in its determination. Each grant will be made contingent upon the final terms of the San Diego agreement, which expire in four years. Under this agreement, each grantee will gain an additional year to complete the research, which must be honored with a future collaboration contract. If we do not reach an agreement by the end of this year, any funding that reaches an agreement will be null and void. Under this agreement, if we do not reach an agreement by the end of 2018, any funding that reaches an agreement will be renewable and invalid. And under this agreement, in case of doubt, we will complete the venture capital program that has already begun in Illinois and will continue in Japan. This program will focus on providing cheap, reliable, affordable energy that can compete with advanced nations and feed into battery technology. When this program is complete, every American citizen will have access to clean, reliable energy. When this program is not complete, American consumers, and our friends, will suffer. Either way, it's a victory for freedom and progress. The venture capital program that is funding our entrepreneurs is a victory for innovation and a victory for a brighter future. The technologies that constitute our economy are changing and adapting to meet new challenges. As we explore promising areas of research, we must also continue to invest in the technologies that enable us to do so. We should always be cognizant that government intervention can fail on the grounds that we lack the funds or the commitment or the will to act. Yet Congress has given venture capital funds a free pass because they violate the spirit and letter of the federal gift to the public. The federal gift to the public is clear, as are the congressional districts that lie below it. A coalition of concerned citizens has made good
