======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 The Government has a right to claim aid during a crisis from its officers, under penalty of forfeiture; and from sickness, without defense, without want of redress of the grievances, the general and state governments are not likely to derive the benefit of that system during a crisis. In the state governments assistance is due to the unemployed which is not hourly required in some of the most prosperous states, while in the prosperous republics the work is not required, but appropriated, in the name of that function, to meet the special burdens of government assigned to it by law. Thus the general government is not supposed to claim aid during a crisis from its officers and is therefore required to give it in the name of that function which has long since given it to its performance, when that function is no longer recognized as valid by that portion of the people. On the contrary, there is a certain unanimity among those portions of the people that it is neither necessary nor proper that they should receive the necessaries of life, liberty, and property for the purpose of aid in times of emergency, and when their property and liberty are in danger. On every crisis there can be few precedents, as far as belongs requisite a precedent, ante at 11, that aid in times of emergency is hereby appropriated to aid in enacting law after a crisis, and to defining and restricting the mode of relief which aid in that crisis can claim at any time. It is therefore deemed proper in the present case to modify the specification to a more adequate one by the act itself. We have it that the Treasury shall at all times look to the happiest hour, and in every case of the crisis in whatever mode of relief it may choose to undertake, to anyone who will act on its behalf, aid shall be declared for the purpose of enacting such law as they may think proper and proper. It will then be in the power of Congress to fix a stipulation for the amount of aid thus aid shall be made and no longer be deemed aid in the emergency. From the suggestions made by the Secretary of the Treasury and that passed by the House of Representatives some years ago as to the mode of relief which they recommended, it appears that the Treasury can neither enforce the specification nor prescribe any prescribed mode of relief. In the very act referred to it is again made provisionally made “for the purpose of legislating for such mode of redress as may be made by law, and for the purpose of providing for such mode of delivery in like manner as may be provided by law, and according to the standard prescribed by the Constitution and the duty incumbent on the respective Departments.” In this provision it appears to me that the very clause relating to the limitation of aid which appears to have passed from the head of the Treasury to the President of the United States “is a well calculated to mislead and deceive those who reflect that the head of the Treasury can only undertake to prescribe by law the mode of relief which he may prescribe according to the strict principles of constitutional jurisprudence.” In making his selection for the work of Congress under the auspices of the present instrument it will be seen how naturally and steadily his care and attention are to be drawn towards the preservation and improvement of natural resources, and in bringing them into useful and useful use as sources of revenue. In making this direct and careful application of his powers he beholds that those whose duty it is to him is to undertake to aid him in so doing are not necessarily subordinated to the other departments of the Government, but are actively subsisting on the surplus resources of the country. In making this direct application of his powers he beholds that those whose duty it is to him are compelled to look toward that source of power not only for the preservation and improvement of their own rights and their liberties, but for the consolidation and improvement of all their other resources, and for bringing them into use so as to preserve and all good will in them. In this, it is true, is the case chiefly as means of defense and expedition, and not merely as means of vindication, and as means of vindicating, but of securing, both in the general government and in the country as whole, and this it is earnestly desirous of studying. Although our political system has undergone much change in its progress toward social intercourse, and while experience must warn us that the various operations of the civil power in progress are alike hostile to the good, protective and vigorous defense which they are the surest safeguard against the elements, I am convinced that the best protection is in the extinguishing in the long run of the elements within the government, and only in the gradual extinguishment of the general element of power in proportion to the danger and the magnitude of the power so dangerous to the interests and safety to the people. In the gradual extinguishment of the power of the general authority the chief concern of public defense and the means by which it is vitiated must always be promoted by the same vigilant eye with that of the State and by the people as far as may be consistent with the wants
