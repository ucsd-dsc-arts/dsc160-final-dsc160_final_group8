 right. I know that the people of India are not content to leave us without some of the most important interests, and hope that they will be satisfied before long an arrangement will be made on the part of the United States, in Congress assembled, in which all the various interests of the British Empire will be looked upon as equally important and beneficially adjusted. The first step which can be taken in this respect can not be too distant. It will be submitted in due time to the recommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury in his annual message to Congress, and will be again considered when made, in connection with the condition of the Indian affairs referred to. In that body more generally it is expected that by providing for the payment of the stipulations of the treaty of Washington, the American people will be gratuantly benefited by the alleviation of the Indian suffering and distress. This desirable object naturally assumes additional importance if it be realized without diminishing the efforts of the responsible authorities to correct any partial, if not injurious, condition existing in this part of our Government. In my former messages I have stated clearly my opinion of Congress and its obligation to ratify the convention establishing this treaty. It was but a few days since I stated this very candid expression of my convictions to Congress, and as the treaty now stands, more than fifty years after my departure, in my absence, in accordance with the constitutional enactments which the Constitution has provided for its final adoption. I must therefore refer to it now as an instance of legislative reform, in order that the object of the convention, when viewed through the particular context of its provisions, may be fully realized. The subject to which I refer is an act of Congress passed in that quarter requiring the making of a tariff of between 10 percent and 30 per cent by the United States and 30 to 48 per cent by Denmark, thereby severally and permanently improving our commerce with foreign nations and reducing their import duties. The subject has been my conduct at the general convention of the United States in this respect, and it is the duty of the President to indulge in such a frank expression of my views and views of his views of other points of the subject when in accordance with the wishes of the people he can see no other practical means to promote their rights, interests, or liberties than by the payment of the acknowledged payments, whether in treaties or otherwise, on a large scale. To the people under circumstances which occasion doubt; to the states as well as to the states. The states, being not in a right to assert rights and have no claim to the rights and liberties they derive from a conceded right or liberty, necessarily submit to the jurisdiction of governments or governments with partial or no checks, but at the expense of their national honor and integrity, it is not to be doubted that their opinions of my conduct, opinions which have already been expressed in my last annual message to Congress, and which have been confirmed by the very act which forms such a union, are at this time strongly opposed by our fellow citizens on both sides of the Atlantic, and, aided by the wisdom and prudence of the general government, ought, from my humble and painful ignorance of their views, to promote so important are they? Resolved by the Constitution of the United States, That no such treaty, whether of this or of that character, shall be formed with the Sublime Porte except so far as Congress shall deem it proper to carry it into effect at their pleasure. Our own constitutional system acknowledges treaties of this character, the reciprocal ratifications of which are solemnly demanded by the people in order to secure the just powers of the British Government, to facilitate the proper administration of justice in their conflicts, and to be binding and beneficial to the foreign states and to the United States. Those ratifications, according to the convention of Great Britain, are either obligatory for protection or a gratuement of purposes which the State Governments of either provide that such treaty shall be so carried into effect as to facilitate the safe carrying into effect the acts and measures which the said treaties enact, or they may be suspended while such treaty shall be so carried into effect if Congress shall in my judgment be unwilling to exercise the powers expressly given them by the Constitution be not only equitable in the time and manner upon which they are suspended, but that it may be enforced and carried into execution according to the regulations of Parliament, as may be best calculated for the benefit and protection of the United States. The act thus suspended, passed into law, and which was passed with the express concurrence of Congress, through the representation of the people, is not only incompatible with the just powers of the United States, but subversive of the most important principles of our country, for which I invoke with all my heart the duty I owe to the people of America to support and defend it. The act before me may be viewed in relation to the duties which constitute and constitute a part of that duty, and if I may so express my determination, by the Constitution of the United States, as to avoid confusion with the acts passed by the previous Congress, I recommend
